AB Objective: To investigate the effects of different coffee amounts on dietary intake and appetite feelings in normal-weight and overweight/obese individuals.
   Design and Methods: Thirty-three volunteers (16 normal-weight, 17 overweight/obese) participated in three trials: they consumed a standard breakfast along with 200 ml of either coffee with 3 or 6 mg caffeine/kg body weight (Coffee 3 and Coffee 6, respectively), or water. At fasting and at standard time points for the 3 h following breakfast/drink consumption participants recorded their appetite feelings on visual analogue scales. At 180 min, participants consumed an ad libitum meal and the next day they recalled their food intake during the experimental day.
   Results: A significant intervention effect was found for the energy intake of the ad libitum meal (P = 0.05) and of the whole day (P = 0.02) only in overweight/obese individuals. Specifically, Coffee 6 resulted in a reduced energy intake during the ad libitum meal compared to Coffee 3 (P = 0.03) and in the total day compared to both water (P = 0.04) and Coffee 3 (P = 0.008). No effect was observed for the appetite feelings.
   Conclusions: A moderate coffee amount can effectively reduce energy intake in the following meal and in the total day compared to lower or no coffee intake in overweight/obese participants.

AB Objective: There is evidence from several empirical studies suggesting that coffee may help people control body weight. Our objective was to assess the effects of caffeine, caffeinated coffee, and decaffeinated coffee, both alone and in combination with 75 g of glucose, on perceived hunger and satiety and related peptides.
   Methods: We conducted a placebo-controlled single-blinded randomized 4-way crossover trial. Eleven healthy male volunteers (mean age, 23.5 +/- 5.7 years; mean BMI, 23.6 +/- 4.2 kg/m(2)) ingested 1 of 3 test beverages (caffeine in water, caffeinated coffee, or decaffeinated coffee) or placebo (water), and 60 minutes later they ingested the glucose. Eight times during each laboratory visit, hunger and satiety were assessed by visual analog scales, and blood samples were drawn to measure 3 endogenous peptides associated with hunger and satiety: ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY), and leptin.
   Results: Compared to placebo, decaffeinated coffee yielded significantly lower hunger during the whole 180-minute study period and higher plasma PYY for the first 90 minutes (p < 0.05). Caffeine in water had no effects on hunger or PYY. Caffeinated coffee showed a pattern between that of decaffeinated coffee and caffeine in water. These findings suggest that one or more noncaffeine ingredients in coffee may have the potential to decrease body weight. Glucose ingestion did not change the effects of the beverages.
   Conclusions: Our randomized human trial showed that decaffeinated coffee can acutely decrease hunger and increase the satiety hormone PYY.

AB Objective. To examine the effects of different coffee amounts on blood glucose and insulin concentrations of healthy volunteers, and to assess potential effect modification by sex and body mass index category.
   Materials/Methods. Thirty-three volunteers [16 female/17 male, 16 normal-weight and 17 overweight/obese, 27.3 +/- 7.2 (19-44) y] took part in this randomized, crossover study. In the morning of each experimental day volunteers received a standardized meal along with 200 mL of water or instant coffee containing either 3 or 6 mg of caffeine/kg body weight. Blood samples were obtained and analyzed for glucose and insulin concentrations in the fasting state, immediately after meal/drink consumption and at standard time points for the next 3 h thereafter.
   Results. Coffee delayed the rise of insulin in response to the standardized meal and the fall of glucose concentrations from its maximum levels in the entire study sample. Glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) was significantly different between interventions (P = .009) with both coffee amounts inducing a greater area compared to water. Secondary, subgroup analysis at the nominal level showed that this might be more evident among females (P-IAUC = .05) and overweight/obese participants (P-IAUC = .03). Furthermore, coffee, mainly the 6 mg dose, could be lowering insulin concentrations the first 30 min after its consumption compared to water in men and overweight/obese participants.
   Conclusions. Coffee exerts an acute effect on postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. This effect may be modified by sex and overweight/obese status. Future research is necessary to elucidate underlying mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE - The epidemiological association between coffee drinking and decreased risk Of type 2 diabetes is strong. However, caffeinated coffee acutely impairs glucose metabolism. We assessed acute effects of decaffeinated coffee on glucose and insulin levels.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - This was a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of decaffeinated coffee, caffeinated coffee, and caffeine on glucose, insulin, and glucose-de pendent insulinotropic poly-peptide (GIP) levels during a 2-h Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 11 young men.
   RESULTS - Within the first hour Of the CGTT, glucose and insulin were higher for decaffeinated coffee than for placebo (P < 0.05). During the whole OGTT, decaffeinated coffee yielded higher insulin than placebo and lower glucose and a higher insulin sensitivity index than caffeine. Changes in GIP could not explain any beverage effects on glucose and insulin.
   CONCLUSIONS - Some types of decaffeinated coffee may acutely impair glucose metabolism but less than caffeine.

AB We have previously demonstrated that coffee and caffeine ameliorated hyperglycemia in spontaneously diabetic KK-A(y) mice. This present study evaluates the antidiabetic effects of coffee and caffeine on high-fat-diet-induced impaired glucose tolerance in C57BL/6J mice. C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet were given regular drinking water (control group), or a 2.5-fold-diluted coffee or caffeine solution (200 mg/L) for 17 weeks. The ingestion of Coffee or caffeine improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and hyperinsulinemia when compared with mice in the control group. The adipose tissue mRNA levels of inflammatory adipocytokines (MCP-1 and IL-6) and the liver mRNA levels of genes related to fatty acid synthesis were lower in the coffee and caffeine groups than those in the control group. These results suggest that coffee and caffeine exerted an ameliorative effect on high-fat-diet-induced impaired glucose tolerance by improving insulin sensitivity. This effect might be attributable in part to the reduction of inflammatory adipocytokine expression.

AB The beneficial health effects of chlorogenic acids (CGAs), major components of coffee beans, are well known and have been attributed to multiple mechanisms of action. However, the lipolytic activity of CGAs does not appear to have been reported. We studied the effects of varying concentrations of Svetol (R), a decaffeinated green coffee bean extract enriched in CGAs, on the liberation of free fatty acids from human adipocytes following short-term (2h) and long-term (192h) exposure. The results showed that although lipolytic activity observed following short-term incubation could be tentatively linked to residual caffeine traces in the sample, longer-term exposure clearly showed the effects of Svetol (R) on release of free fatty acids, and this effect was not due to caffeine. The results of this study provide a further mechanism by which to explain the long-term health benefits of CGAs and Svetol (R). Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Obesity has become a public health concern due to its positive association with the incidence of many diseases, and coffee components including chlorogenic acid (CGA) and caffeine have been demonstrated to play roles in the suppression of fat accumulation. To investigate the mechanism by which CGA and caffeine regulate lipid metabolism, in the present study, forty mice were randomly assigned to four groups and fed diets containing no CGA or caffeine, CGA, caffeine, or CGA + caffeine for 24 weeks. Body weight, intraperitoneal adipose tissue (IPAT) weight, and serum biochemical parameters were measured, and the activities and mRNA and protein expression of lipid metabolism-related enzymes were analysed. There was a decrease in the body weight and IPAT weight of mice fed the CGA + caffeine diet. There was a significant decrease in the serum and hepatic concentrations of total cholesterol, TAG and leptin of mice fed the CGA + caffeine diet. The activities of carnitine acyltransferase (CAT) and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) were increased in mice fed the caffeine and CGA + caffeine diets, while the activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) was suppressed in those fed the CGA + caffeine diet. The mRNA expression levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), CAT and ACO were considerably up-regulated in mice fed the CGA + caffeine diet, while those of PPAR gamma 2 were down-regulated. The protein expression levels of AMPK were increased and those of FAS were decreased in mice fed the CGA + caffeine diet. These results indicate that CGA + caffeine suppresses fat accumulation and body weight gain by regulating the activities and mRNA and protein expression levels of hepatic lipid metabolism-related enzymes and that these effects are stronger than those exerted by CGA and caffeine individually.

AB Coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that this is mediated by incretin hormones by measuring the acute effects of decaffeinated coffee and coffee components on GLP-1 and GIP concentrations. A randomized cross-over trial of the effects of 12 g decaffeinated coffee, 1 g chlorogenic acid, 500 mg trigonelline, and placebo on total and intact GLP-1 and GIP concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test took place in fifteen overweight men. No treatment significantly affected the overall GLP-1 or GIP secretion pattern following an OGTT relative to placebo. Decaffeinated coffee slightly increased total GLP-1 concentration 30 minutes after ingestion (before the OGTT) relative to placebo (2.7 pmol/L, p = 0.03), but this change did not correspond with changes in glucose or insulin secretion. These findings do not support the hypothesis that coffee acutely improves glucose tolerance through effects on the secretion of incretin hormones. Chronic effects of coffee and its major components still need to be investigated.

AB Dietary polyphenols may have a protective role against the development of CVD. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of green coffee (GC), rich in chlorogenic acid, and black coffee (BC) on cardiovascular markers. A randomised pilot crossover study was performed on healthy subjects who consumed both coffees for 2 weeks. We measured anthropometry, blood pressure, and arterial elasticity after each intervention and collected urine samples to monitor antioxidant capacity. Free cortisol and cortisone levels were obtained from urine and analysed by specific ELISA methods. Systolic blood pressure (P = 0.018) and arterial elasticity (P = 0.001) were significantly reduced after GC. BMI (P = 0.04 for BC; P = 0.01 for GC) and abdominal fat (P = 0.01 for BC; P = 0.009 for GC) were also significantly reduced with no changes in energy intake. Urinary free cortisol was significantly reduced from 125.6 +/- 85.9 nmol/day to 76.0 +/- 54.9 nmol/day following GC and increased to 132.1 +/- 89.1 nmol/day after BC. Urinary free cortisone increased by 18% following BC and 9% following GC (nonsignificant). Cortisol/cortisone ratio (indicating 11 beta-HSD1 activity) was reduced after GC (from 3.5 +/- 1.9 to 1.7 +/- 1.04, P = 0.002). This suggests that GC can play a role in reducing cardiovascular risk factors. Further research including hypertensive and overweight individuals will now be justified to clarify whether GC could have a therapeutic role in CVD.

AB Coffee, a rich source of natural products, including caffeine, chlorogenic acid, and diterpenoid alcohols, has been part of the human diet since the 15th century. In this study, we characterized the effects of Colombian coffee extract (CE), which contains high concentrations of caffeine and diterpenoids, on a rat model of human metabolic syndrome. The 8-9 wk old male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Two groups of rats were fed a corn starch-rich diet whereas the other two groups were given a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet with 25% fructose in drinking water for 16 wk. One group fed each diet was supplemented with 5% aqueous CE for the final 8 wk of this protocol. The corn starch diet contained similar to 68% carbohydrates mainly as polysaccharides, whereas the high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet contained similar to 68% carbohydrates mainly as fructose and sucrose together with 24% fat, mainly as saturated and monounsaturated fat from beef tallow. The high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-fed rats showed the symptoms of metabolic syndrome leading to cardiovascular remodeling and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. CE supplementation attenuated impairment in glucose tolerance, hypertension, cardiovascular remodeling, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease without changing abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia. This study suggests that CE can attenuate diet-induced changes in the structure and function of the heart and the liver without changing the abdominal fat deposition. J. Nutr. 142: 690-697, 2012.

AB Over the past decades, chronic sleep reduction and a concurrent development of obesity have been recognized as a common problem in the industrialized world. Among its numerous untoward effects, there is a possibility that insomnia is also a major contributor to obesity. This attribution poses a problem for caffeine, an inexpensive, "natural" agent that is purported to improve a number of conditions and is often indicated in a long-term pharmacotherapy in the context of weight management. The present study used the "common target" approach by exploring the tentative shared molecular networks of insomnia and adiposity. It discusses caffeine targets beyond those associated with adenosine signaling machinery, phosphodiesterases, and calcium release channels. Here, we provide a view suggesting that caffeine could exert some of its effects by acting on several signaling complexes composed of HIF-1 alpha/VEGF/IL-8 along with NO, TNF-alpha, IL1, and GHRH, among others. Although the relevance of these targets to the reported therapeutic effects of caffeine has remained difficult to assess, the utilization of caffeine efficacies and potencies recommend its repurposing for development of novel therapeutic approaches. Among indications mentioned, are neuroprotective, nootropic, antioxidant, proliferative, anti-fibrotic, and anti-angiogenic that appear under a variety of dissimilar diagnostic labels comorbid with obesity. In the absence of safe and efficacious antiobesity agents, caffeine remains an attractive adjuvant.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to examine the relation between eating habits and a high body mass index (BMI) in first-year freshman university students and included 2525 freshman university students 18 to 22 years old from a Turkish population.
   Methods: in this study, 48% of the students were men. They were asked to complete a questionnaire on their dietary habits including the frequency of their consumption of individual food items, demographic data, and smoking habit.
   Results: The effects of eating habits on increased BMI (>= 25) were analyzed. Of 2259 subjects included in the analyses, 322 were overweight or obese and 1937 had normal and thin BMI (<25). Multivariate analyses identified male gender, recent weight change, and high number of meals as independent predictors of obesity/overweight. Frequent consumptions of beer, alcoholic drinks other than beer and wine (e.g., spirits including whisky, gin, raid, vodka), coffee, tea, coke, red meat, variety meat, and eggs were associated with a significantly higher risk of obesity/overweight, whereas frequent consumption of snacks was associated with a low risk.
   Conclusions: Findings of further studies, possibly taking into consideration the absolute quantities of consumption along with cultural and local issues, would guide the adoption of healthier feeding behaviors in this particular age group.

AB Recent epidemiological studies showed that coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, presumably due to suppression of excess fat accumulation in adipocytes. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of coffee on adipocyte differentiation has not been well documented. To elucidate the mechanism, we investigated the effect of coffee on the differentiation of mouse preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. Coffee reduced the accumulation of lipids during adipocytic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. At 5% coffee, the accumulation of lipids decreased to half that of the control. Coffee also inhibited the expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), a transcription factor controlling the differentiation of adipocytes. Furthermore, coffee reduced the expression of other differentiation marker genes, aP2, adiponectin, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), during adipocyte differentiation. Major bioactive constituents in coffee extracts, such as caffeine, trigonelline, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid, showed no effect on PPAR gamma gene expression. The inhibitory activity was produced by the roasting of the coffee beans.

AB We have investigated the effects of the major polyphenol in coffee, chlorogenic acid (CGA), on obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, systemic oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in a mouse model of the metabolic syndrome. Thirty C57BL6 mice were randomly divided into (n = 10/group) (i) normal diet (ND), (ii) high fat diet (HFD), or (iii) high fat diet supplemented with 0.5% w/w green coffee bean extract (GCE) rich in chlorogenic acid (HFD + GCE). The high fat diet consisted of 28% fat and all animals were maintained on their diets for 12 weeks. The mice fed a HFD and HFD + GCE displayed symptoms of the metabolic syndrome compared to their normal fed counterparts, although no endothelial dysfunction was detected in the abdominal aortas after 12 weeks. GCE did not attenuate HFD-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance or systemic oxidative stress. Furthermore, GCE did not protect against ex vivo oxidant (hypochlorous acid)-induced endothelial dysfunction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is plausible biological evidence as well as epidemiologic evidence to suggest coffee consumption may lower endometrial cancer risk. We evaluated the associations between self-reported total coffee, caffeinated coffee and decaffeinated coffee, and endometrial cancer risk using the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study Research Materials obtained from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Biological Specimen and Data Repository Coordinating Center. Our primary analyses included 45,696 women and 427 incident endometrial cancer cases, diagnosed over a total of 342,927 person-years of follow-up. We used Cox-proportional hazard models to evaluate coffee consumption and endometrial cancer risk. Overall, we did not find an association between coffee consumption and endometrial cancer risk. Compared to non-daily drinkers (none or <1 cup/day), the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for women who drank >= 4 cups/day were 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63, 1.18) for total coffee, 0.89 (95% CI 0.63, 1.27) for caffeinated coffee, and 0.51 (95% CI 0.25, 1.03) for decaf coffee. In subgroup analyses by body mass index (BMI) there were no associations among normal-weight and overweight women for total coffee and caffeinated coffee. However among obese women, compared to the referent group (none or <1 cup/day), the hazard ratios for women who drank >= 2 cups/day were: 0.72 (95% CI 0.50, 1.04) for total coffee and 0.66 (95% CI 0.45, 0.97) for caffeinated coffee. Hazard ratios for women who drank >= 2 cups/day for decaffeinated coffee drinkers were 0.67 (0.43-1.06), 0.93 (0.55-1.58) and 0.80 (0.49-1.30) for normal, overweight and obese women, respectively. Our study suggests that caffeinated coffee consumption may be associated with lower endometrial cancer risk among obese postmenopausal women, but the association with decaffeinated coffee remains unclear.

AB Scope: Obesity has been found to be associated with low grade inflammation accompanied by chronic oxidative stress. The transcription factor Nrf2 is likely involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation processes, possibly mediated by an antioxidant response element (ARE)-similar region located in the promoter of lipogenic genes like peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL6). The present study investigates the influence of coffee consumption on the transcription of obesity-associated genes in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Two different coffee blends with comparable caffeine concentrations were provided, rich either in chlorogenic acids and trigonelline (market blend, MB) or in N-methylpyridinium (NMP, study blend, SB).
   Methods and results: In a cross-over randomized double blind intervention study 84 volunteers (male and female, 25.6 +/- 5.8 years, BMI 22.9 +/- 1.9 kg/m(2), healthy, nonsmokers, regular coffee drinker) daily consumed 750 mL of the respective coffee over a period of 4 weeks, respectively. Transcription of IL6 in PBL was found to be positively associated with body fat. In the first intervention period consumption of MB decreased significantly the transcription of Nrf2, PPAR gamma and IL6 while concomitantly an enhanced level of PPAR alpha mRNA was found. Due to carry-over effects for Nrf2 and PPAR alpha, data of both intervention periods could only be pooled for PPAR gamma and IL6. Pooled data from both intervention periods showed a significant decrease of IL6 transcripts for SB consumption only. The changes in gene transcription appear to correlate with the level of different CGA metabolites in the plasma of the volunteers. Initial results further indicate a potential contribution of genetic polymorphisms in the nrf2 promoter and the ppar gamma-gene to the influence of coffee consumption on PPAR gamma transcription.
   Conclusion: Regular coffee consumption affects the transcription of genes associated with obesity and/or inflammation. Metabolites of chlorogenic acids as well as genetic polymorphisms may be relevant influencing factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Green tea, coffee, and gomchui (Ligularia fischeri) tea, which are rich in polyphenols, may exhibit antiobesity effects by inhibiting pancreatic lipase. However, the bioavailability of some polyphenols is poor due to either degradation or absorption difficulties in the gastrointestinal tract, thus making their beneficial effects doubtful. This study was conducted,to evaluate the inhibitory effect of three beverages on lipolysis and the contribution of their major polyphenols during simulated digestion. During simulated digestion, gomchui tea was the most potent at inhibiting gastrointestinal lipolysis, whereas green tea was the least potent. The strongest lipase inhibitor among purified major polyphenols was a green tea polyphenol, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, IC50 = 1.8 +/- 0.57 mu M), followed by di-O-caffeoylquinic acid isomers (DCQA, IC50 from 12.7 +/- 4.5 to 404 +/- 23 mu M), which are gomchui tea polyphenols. However, the stability of DCQA was greater than that of EGCG when subjected to simulated digestion. Taken together, gomchui tea, which has DCQA as the major polyphenol, showed stronger lipolysis inhibitory activity during simulated digestion compared to both green tea and coffee.

AB Extracts of olive leaf, green coffee bean and beetroot may deliver cardiovascular benefits. This study sought to evaluate the effects of regularly consuming a combination of these extracts on blood pressure (BP), arterial compliance, blood lipids, blood glucose and insulin sensitivity. A double-blind randomised placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted in adults with untreated high normal or borderline elevated BP. They were randomised to take an active supplement, comprising 500 mg olive leaf extract, 100 mg green coffee bean extract and 150 mg beet powder, or a matching placebo twice daily for six weeks, followed by the alternate supplement for a further six weeks. Assessments of 24-h ambulatory BP (ABP), clinic BP arterial compliance (pulse-wave analysis), blood lipids, blood glucose and insulin were obtained at baseline and at the end of each treatment phase. Baseline clinic BP in 37 overweight middle-aged men and women who completed the trial averaged 145/84 mmHg. There was no significant effect of treatment on ABP or any other outcome measure. The failure to confirm prior evidence of the antihypertensive benefits of these extracts emphasises the importance of placebo control and the value of ABP monitoring. Further dose-response evaluation of olive leaf, green coffee bean or beetroot extracts is required to confirm or refute the purported benefits.

AB Background: Coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in prospective cohort studies, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of regular and decaffeinated coffee on biological risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: Randomized parallel-arm intervention conducted in 45 healthy overweight volunteers who were nonsmokers and regular coffee consumers. Participants were assigned to consumption of 5 cups (177 mL each) per day of instant caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, or no coffee (i.e., water) for 8 weeks.
   Results: Average age was 40 years and body mass index was 29.5 kg/m(2). Compared with consuming no coffee, consumption of caffeinated coffee increased adiponectin (difference in change from baseline 1.4 mu g/mL; 95% CI: 0.2, 2.7) and interleukin-6 (difference: 60%; 95% CI: 8, 138) concentrations and consumption of decaffeinated coffee decreased fetuin-A concentrations (difference: -20%; 95% CI: -35, -1). For measures of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion, no significant differences were found between treatment groups.
   Conclusions: Although no changes in glycemia and/or insulin sensitivity were observed after 8 weeks of coffee consumption, improvements in adipocyte and liver function as indicated by changes in adiponectin and fetuin-A concentrations may contribute to beneficial metabolic effects of long-term coffee consumption.

AB Several lines of evidence, including those from epidemiological studies, have suggested that coffee intake reduces the risks of diabetes and obesity, although the detailed mechanisms of such effects are not clearly understood. The present study was conducted to examine the effects of three types of coffee (caffeinated, decaffeinated, and green unroasted coffee) on the livers of C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet, and to elucidate the detailed physiological responses to coffee intake by analysing the data obtained from a transcriptomic analysis using DNA microarrays. The results showed that the three types of coffee suppressed the weight gain and fat accumulation induced by a high-fat diet. A remarkable finding was a down-regulation of PPAR gamma and related molecules. Furthermore, the protein levels of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) were revealed by Western blot analysis to be lower in all of the coffee-fed groups compared to the high-fat group. Since overexpression of PPAR gamma in the liver has been implicated in adipogenic hepatic steatosis, we hypothesised that the alterations in PPAR gamma and its target molecules, which play pivotal roles in adipogenic hepatic steatosis, might be involved in the anti-obesity effect of coffee.

AB Purpose of reviewTea and coffee, after water, are the most commonly consumed beverages in the world and are the top sources of caffeine and antioxidant polyphenols in the American diet. The purpose of this review is to assess the health effects of chronic tea and/or coffee consumption.Recent findingsTea consumption, especially green tea, is associated with significantly reduced risks for stroke, diabetes and depression, and improved levels of glucose, cholesterol, abdominal obesity and blood pressure. Habitual coffee consumption in large epidemiological studies is associated with reduced mortality, both for all-cause and cardiovascular deaths. In addition, coffee intake is associated with risks of heart failure, stroke, diabetes mellitus and some cancers in an inverse dose-dependent fashion. Surprisingly, coffee is associated with neutral to reduced risks for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. However, caffeine at high doses can increase anxiety, insomnia, calcium loss and possibly the risk of fractures.SummaryCoffee and tea can generally be recommended as health-promoting additions to an adult diet. Adequate dietary calcium intake may be particularly important for tea and coffee drinkers.

AB The increasing prevalence of the metabolic syndrome requires a greater need for therapeutic and prevention strategies. Higher coffee consumption is consistently associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in population studies. Dietary polyphenols have been linked to benefits on several features of the metabolic syndrome. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a major component of coffee, is one of the most consumed polyphenols in the diet. In our study, we conducted a controlled dietary intervention over 12 weeks in male mice. There were three dietary groups: (i) normal diet, (ii) high-fat diet, and (iii) high-fat diet + CGA. We assessed the effect of CGA at a physiologically obtainable dose (1 g/kg of diet) on high-fat-diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and also fatty acid oxidation and insulin signaling in C57BL/6 male mice. Supplementation of CGA in the high-fat diet did not reduce body weight compared to mice fed the high-fat diet alone (p = 0.32). CGA resulted in increased insulin resistance compared to mice fed a high-fat diet only (p < 0.05). CGA resulted in decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (p < 0.001) and acetyl carboxylase beta (ACC beta), a downstream target of AMPK (p < 0.05), in liver. The liver of mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented with CGA had a higher lipid content (p < 0.05) and more steatosis relative to mice fed a high-fat diet only, indicating impaired fatty acid oxidation. This study suggests that CGA supplementation in a high-fat diet does not protect against features of the metabolic syndrome in diet-induced obese mice.

AB Background/Objectives: Coffee is the most widely consumed beverage in the world, but its effect on the cardiovascular system has not been fully understood. Coffee contains caffeine and antioxidants, which may influence endothelial function, both of which have not yet been investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the acute effects of coffee on endothelial function measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD).
   Subjects/Methods: A total of 20 (10 males and 10 females) healthy non-obese subjects underwent a double-blind, crossover study. Subjects ingested one cup of caffeinated (CC) and one cup of decaffeinated (DC) Italian espresso coffee in random order at 5- to 7-day intervals.
   Results: Following CC ingestion, FMD decreased progressively and significantly (mean +/- s.e.m.: 0 min, 7.7 +/- 0.6; 30 min, 6.3 +/- 0.7; 60 min, 6.0 +/- 0.8%; ANOVA (analysis of variance), P<0.05), but it did not significantly increase after DC ingestion (0 min, 6.9 +/- 0.6; 30 min, 8.1 +/- 0.9; 60 min, 8.5 +/- 0.9%; P = 0.115). Similarly, CC significantly increased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure; this effect was not observed after DC ingestion. Blood glucose concentrations remained unchanged after ingestion of both CC and DC, but insulin (0 min, 15.8 +/- 0.9; 60 min, 15.0 +/- 0.8 mu U/ml; P<0.05) and C-peptide (0 min, 1.25 +/- 0.09; 60 min, 1.18 +/- 0.09 ng/ml; P<0.01) blood concentrations decreased significantly only after CC ingestion.
   Conclusions: CC acutely induced unfavorable cardiovascular effects, especially on endothelial function. In the fasting state, insulin secretion is also likely reduced after CC ingestion. Future studies will determine whether CC has detrimental clinically relevant effects, especially in unhealthy subjects.

AB 5-Caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA) is generally referred to as chlorogenic acid and exhibits various biological activities such as antioxidant activity and porcine pancreas a-amylase inhibitory activities. 5-CQA may be useful as an antioxidant for food and to prevent diabetes and obesity. The degradation of 5-CQA and caffeic acid (CA) in an aqueous solution at 37 degrees C and pH 5.0-9.0 was studied. The degradation of 5-CQA and CA, demonstrating time and pH dependence (i.e., the rate constant, k, was higher at higher pH), was satisfactorily described by the Weibull equation. The stability of 5-CQA at pH 7.4 and 9.0 was improved by adding (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and ascorbic acid (AA). Moreover, the degradation of 5-CQA in the presence of EGCG or AA could be described by the Weibull equation. The k value in the presence of EGCG or AA was dependent on their concentration.

AB Postprandial energy metabolism, including postprandial hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia, is related to the risk for developing obesity and CVD. In the present study, we examined the effects of polyphenols purified from coffee (coffee polyphenols (CPP)) on postprandial carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and whole-body substrate oxidation in C57BL/6J mice. In mice that co-ingested CPP with a lipid-carbohydrate (sucrose or starch)-mixed emulsion, the respiratory quotient determined by indirect calorimetry was significantly lower than that in control mice, whereas there was no difference in V-O2 (energy expenditure), indicating that CPP modulates postprandial energy partitioning. CPP also suppressed postprandial increases in plasma glucose, insulin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and TAG levels. Inhibition experiments on digestive enzymes revealed that CPP inhibits maltase and sucrase, and, to a lesser extent, pancreatic lipase in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the nine kinds of polyphenols (caffeoyl quinic acids (CQA), di-CQA, feruloyl quinic acids (FQA)) contained in CPP, di-CQA showed more potent inhibitory activity than CQA or FQA on these digestive enzymes, suggesting a predominant role of di-CQA in the regulation of postprandial energy metabolism. These results suggest that CPP modulates whole-body substrate oxidation by suppressing postprandial hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, and these effects are mediated by inhibiting digestive enzymes.

AB Apart from four major catechins present in Camellia sinensis (tea), four major methylxanthines are also present in tea aqueous extract. Caffeine with its structural similarity to uric acid is the predominant methylxanthine in tea and it is known to contribute to hypertension and obesity leading to diabetes. Caffeine intake from tea, soft drinks and candies may be contributing to high level of obesity and diabetes prevalent in Kuwait. There are a variety of hot drinks that are traditional to the culture of Kuwait and their caffeine content has not been established. In this study we have undertaken to establish caffeine content in traditional hot drinks used in Kuwait and have found that Arabic Gahwa, a very popular hot drink in Kuwait, has one of the lowest caffeine content among coffee drinks but its high frequency of consumption may have an additive effect on caffeine intake. Caffeine content of commercial brands and herbal teas used in Kuwait has also been established and found that Rabea black tea had the highest caffeine and theobromine content, while Red label black tea has the lowest caffeine. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to establish methylxanthine content in different tea aqueous extracts. A comparison of caffeine content in various hot drinks is presented.

AB Background: Coffee and tea consumption was hypothesized to interact with variants of vitamin D-receptor polymorphisms, but limited evidence exists. Here we determine for the first time whether increased coffee and tea consumption affects circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in a cohort of Saudi adolescents.
   Methods: A total of 330 randomly selected Saudi adolescents were included. Anthropometrics were recorded and fasting blood samples were analyzed for routine analysis of fasting glucose, lipid levels, calcium, albumin and phosphorous. Frequency of coffee and tea intake was noted. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
   Results: Improved lipid profiles were observed in both boys and girls, as demonstrated by increased levels of HDL-cholesterol, even after controlling for age and BMI, among those consuming 9-12 cups of coffee/week. Vitamin D levels were significantly highest among those consuming 9-12 cups of tea/week in all subjects (p-value 0.009) independent of age, gender, BMI, physical activity and sun exposure.
   Conclusion: This study suggests a link between tea consumption and vitamin D levels in a cohort of Saudi adolescents, independent of age, BMI, gender, physical activity and sun exposure. These findings should be confirmed prospectively.

AB This study investigated the efficacy of chlorogenic acid on altering body fat in high-fat diet (37% calories from fat) induced-obese mice compared to caffeic acid. Caffeic acid or chlorogenic acid was supplemented with high-fat diet at 0.02% (wt/wt) dose. Both caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid significantly lowered body weight, visceral fat mass and plasma leptin and insulin levels compared to the high-fat control group. They also lowered triglyceride (in plasma, liver and heart) and cholesterol (in plasma, adipose tissue and heart) concentrations. Triglyceride content in adipose tissue was significantly lowered, whereas the plasma adiponectin level was elevated by chlorogenic acid supplementation compared to the high-fat control group. Body weight was significantly correlated with plasma leptin (r = 0.894. p < 0.01) and insulin (r = 0.496, p < 0.01) levels, respectively. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid significantly inhibited fatty acid synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase and acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase activities, while they increased fatty acid beta-oxidation activity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha expression in the liver compared to the high-fat group. These results suggest that caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid improve body weight, lipid metabolism and obesity-related hormones levels in high-fat fed mice. Chlorogenic acid seemed to be more potent for body weight reduction and regulation of lipid metabolism than caffeic acid. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The purposes of this study were to perform a detailed analysis how: i) the frequency of coffee/tea consumption and ii) the use of additives in coffee/tea is associated with measures of total and abdominal obesity. Method: 3,823 participants of the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were examined. Obesity was assessed by BMI and waist circumference (WC). Coffee and tea consumption and use of additives were assessed by questionnaire. Results: Coffee consumption was not related to BMI or WC in either gender. However, men who drank >= 2 cups of tea per day had lower BMI (25.9 vs. 28.0 kg/m(2)) and WC (95.2 vs. 101.32 cm) values than men who never drank drink tea (p <= 0.05). The associations between tea consumption and BMI or WC were no longer significant after adjustment for additive use. Coffee/tea drinkers who used artificial sweeteners had larger (p <= 0.05) BMIs than coffee/tea drinkers who did not use sweeteners (28.2 vs. 27.1 kg/m(2) in men, 28.4 vs. 27.1 kg/m(2) in women). Conclusion: Frequency of coffee/tea consumption was not associated with measures of obesity because additive use explained the association between tea consumption and obesity in men. Artificial sweetener use within coffee/tea was associated with higher BMI.

TI The effects of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee on sex
   hormone-binding globulin and endogenous sex hormone levels: a randomized

AB Background: Findings from observational studies suggest that sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and endogenous sex hormones may be mediators of the putative relation between coffee consumption and lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee on SHBG and sex hormone levels.
   Findings: After a two-week run-in phase with caffeine abstention, we conducted an 8-week parallel-arm randomized controlled trial. Healthy adults (n = 42) were recruited from the Boston community who were regular coffee consumers, nonsmokers, and overweight. Participants were randomized to five 6-ounce cups of caffeinated or decaffeinated instant coffee or water (control group) per day consumed with each meal, mid-morning, and mid-afternoon. The main outcome measures were SHBG and sex hormones [i.e., testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]. No significant differences were found between treatment groups for any of the studied outcomes at week 8. At 4 weeks, decaffeinated coffee was associated with a borderline significant increase in SHBG in women, but not in men. At week 4, we also observed several differences in hormone concentrations between the treatment groups. Among men, consumption of caffeinated coffee increased total testosterone and decreased total and free estradiol. Among women, decaffeinated coffee decreased total and free testosterone and caffeinated coffee decreased total testosterone.
   Conclusions: Our data do not indicate a consistent effect of caffeinated coffee consumption on SHBG in men or women, however results should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size. This is the first randomized trial investigating the effects of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee on SHBG and sex hormones and our findings necessitate further examination in a larger intervention trial.

AB Both sexes of mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks without and with polyphenolic-rich potato extracts (PRPE) of cultivars Onaway and Russet Burbank. PRPE attenuated weight gain in male and female mice by as much as 63.2%, which was associated mostly with a reduction in adiposity. Mice receiving PRPE showed enhanced capacity for blood glucose clearance. Sex differences regarding the impact of HFD and PRPE on plasma levels of insulin, ghrelin, leptin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and resistin were noted. PRPE may serve as part of a preventative dietary strategy against the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

AB Recent results from prospective cohort studies have shown that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk for diabetes mellitus type II or Alzheimer's disease. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases, antioxidants in coffee might contribute to this risk reduction. We aimed at elucidating whether a dark roast coffee beverage (CB) rich in N-methylpyridinium ions (NMP: 785 mu mol/L) and low in chlorogenic acids (CGA: 523 mu mol/L) has stronger antioxidant effects on human erythrocytes than a CB prepared from a light roast with opposite proportions (CGA: 4538 mu mol/L; NMP: 56 mu mol/L). Following a 2-wk wash out period, 500 mL of the respective CB was administered to 30 subjects daily for 4-wk. Blood and spot urine samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of each intervention. Intake of the dark roast CB most effectively improved the antioxidant status of erythrocytes: superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity decreased by 5.8 and 15%, respectively, whereas tocopherol and total glutathione concentrations increased by 41 and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, administration of the NMP-rich CB led to a significant body weight reduction in pre-obese subjects, whereas the CGA-rich CB did not.

AB Objectives: Partially purified hexane phase (HP) of Peucedanum japonicum Thunb (PJT) was identified as an antiobesity candidate. However, the compound responsible for the antiobesity activity remained unknown. Thus, in this study we isolated the active compound, to determine the mechanisms related to antiobesity activity in vitro.
   Methods: The HP was fractionated, and the effect on the triacylglycerol (TG) content was evaluated in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and HepG2 hepatocytes. On the basis of comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, the structure of the active compound was identified as pteryxin, a known compound in PJT. However, to our knowledge, its biological activities against obesity have not been reported previously. The dose-dependent effect on the TG content, and the gene expressions related to adipogenesis, fatty acid catabolism, energy expenditure, lipolysis, and lipogenesis due to pteryxin (10, 15, and 20 mu g/mL) were examined in vitro.
   Results: Pteryxin dose dependently suppressed TG content in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes (by 52.7%, 53.8%, and 57.4%, respectively; P < 0.05) and HepG2 hepatocytes (by 25.2%, 34.1%, and 27.4%, respectively; P < 0.05). Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase-1 (ACC1) were down-regulated in pteryxin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (by 18%, 36.1%, and 38.2%, P < 0.05) and HepG2 hepatocytes (by 72.3%, 62.9%, and 38.8%, respectively; P < 0.05). The adipocyte size marker gene, paternally expressed genel/ mesoderm specific transcript (MEST) was down-regulated (by 42.8%; P < 0.05), and hormone-sensitive lipase, a lipid catabolizing gene was up-regulated (by 15.1%; P < 0.05) in pteryxin-treated adipocytes. The uncoupling protein 2 (by 77.5%; P < 0.05) and adiponectin (by 76.3%; P > 0.05) were up-regulated due to pteryxin.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that pteryxin in PJT plays the key role in regulating the lipid metabolism-related gene network and improving energy production in vitro. Thus, the results suggest pteryxin as a new natural compound to be used as an antiobesity drug in the pharmaceutical industry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Drinking green tea is associated with many health benefits, including increased fat oxidation. We tested the hypothesis that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the main green tea catechin, increases fat oxidation in obese men.
   Methods: Ten healthy overweight/obese males (body mass index 31.3 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2)) were studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial. Study supplements were low EGCG (300 mg), high EGCG (600 mg), caffeine (200 mg), EGCG/caffeine (300 mg/200 mg) or placebo and were taken orally for 3 days. At the third day of supplementation, O-2 consumption and CO2 production was measured by indirect calorimetry to assess energy expenditure and fat oxidation over 4 h each after overnight fasting and after a standardized test meal.
   Results: Energy expenditure was not affected by any supplementation, neither after overnight fasting nor after the test meal. During the first 2 h after overnight fasting, fat oxidation increased by 7.7 (not significant, NS), 15.2 (NS), 26.3 (P<0.05 vs placebo) and 35.4% (P<0.01 vs placebo and low EGCG), for low EGCG, high EGCG, caffeine and EGCG/caffeine, respectively. During the first 2 h after the meal, the mean increase in fat oxidation was 33.3 (P<0.05 vs placebo), 20.2 (NS), 34.5 (P<0.05 vs placebo) and 49.4% (P<0.05 vs placebo) for low EGCG, high EGCG, caffeine and EGCG/caffeine, respectively.
   Conclusions: Low EGCG increases postprandial fat oxidation in obese men and this to the same extent as 200 mg caffeine, whereas high EGCG does not exert this effect. Fasting fat oxidation is increased only by caffeine (with or without EGCG). There is no synergism of low EGCG and 200 mg caffeine. Energy expenditure is not affected by EGCG.

AB Green tea has been shown to have thermogenic and antiobesity properties. Therefore, it is important to investigate its effect on weight loss in humans, especially in women. We investigated the effects of green tea consumption combined with resistance training on the body composition and the resting metabolic rate (RMR) in women who were overweight or obese (grade I). After 4 weeks on an adaptive diet, 36 women were divided into four groups (group 1, green tea; group 2, placebo; group 3, green tea plus resistance training; group 4, placebo plus resistance training). The study was double-blinded and placebo-controlled. The RMR and body composition were ascertained for each volunteer, blood tests were performed, and subjects in groups 3 and 4 were tested for their one repetition maximum. Each subject followed the protocol and continued the diet for eight additional weeks, and periodic evaluations were administered. The mean RMR of group 1 decreased significantly and was accompanied by weight loss, maintenance of lean body mass, and decreases in both waist circumference and body mass index. Group 2 showed no variations in anthropometric or blood variables and significantly decreased their mean RMR. Group 3 showed significant increases in RMR, lean body mass, and muscle strength, and significant decreases in body fat, triglycerides, and waist circumference as compared to group 4. Green tea combined with resistance training its potential is increased with decreasing body fat, waist circumference, and triacylglyceride levels and by increasing lean body mass and muscle strength.

AB Obesity is a major health problem in the developed and developing world. Many "functional" foods and ingredients are advocated for their effects on body composition but few have consistent scientific support for their efficacy. However, an increasing amount of mechanistic and clinical evidence is building for green tea (GT). This experiment was therefore undertaken to study the effects of a high-catechin GT on body composition in a moderately overweight Chinese population. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, 182 moderately overweight Chinese subjects, consumed either two servings of a control drink (C; 30 mg catechins, 10 mg caffeine/day), one serving of the control drink and one serving of an extra high-catechin GT1 (458 mg catechins, 104 mg caffeine/day), two servings of a high-catechin GT2 (468 mg catechins, 126 mg caffeine/day) or two servings of the extra high-catechin GT3 (886 mg catechins, 198 mg caffeine/day) for 90 days. Data were collected at 0, 30, 60, and 90 days. We observed a decrease in estimated intra-abdominal fat (IAF) area of 5.6 cm(2) in the GT3 group. In addition, we found decreases of 1.9 cm in waist circumference and 1.2 kg body weight in the GT3 group vs. C (P < 0.05). We also observed reductions in total body fat (GT2, 0.7 kg, P < 0.05) and body fat % (GT1, 0.6%, P < 0.05). We conclude that consumption of two servings of an extra high-catechin GT leads to improvements in body composition and reduces abdominal fatness in moderately overweight Chinese subjects.

AB We manufactured a new fermented tea by tea-rolling processing of third-crop green tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves and loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) leaves. The mixed fermented tea extract inhibited pancreatic lipase activity in vitro, and effectively suppressed postprandial hypertriacylglycerolemia in rats. Rats fed a diet containing 1% freeze-dried fermented tea extract for 4 weeks had a significantly lower liver triacylglycerol concentration and white adipose tissue weight than those fed the control diet lacking fermented tea extract. The activity of fatty acid synthase in hepatic cytosol markedly decreased in the fermented tea extract group as compared to the control group. The serum and liver triacylglycerol- and body fat-lowering effects of the mixed fermented tea extract were strong relative to the level of dietary supplementation. These results suggest that the new fermented tea product exhibited hypotriacylglycerolemic and antiobesity properties through suppression of both liver fatty acid synthesis and postprandial hypertriacylglycerolemia by inhibition of pancreatic lipase.

AB Coffee is among the most widely consumed beverages in the world. Numerous epidemiological studies have reported a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Therefore, we conducted an epidemiological study to clarify the relationship between coffee consumption and adiponectin levels in Japanese males. We also evaluated whether green tea consumption affected adiponectin levels.
   We carried out a cross-sectional study. The subjects were 665 male employees in Japan. Coffee consumption was assessed, using a self-administered questionnaire, as the number of times per week and cups per day respondents drank, and subjects were grouped into four levels (non, 1-5 times/week, 1-2 cups/day and a parts per thousand yen3 cups/day).
   The means of adiponectin levels were positively associated with coffee consumption. A dose-response relationship was found between coffee consumption and circulating adiponectin levels. The relationship remained significant after adjustment for potential confounding factors (P for trend < 0.05). However, green tea consumption was not significantly associated with adiponectin levels (P for trend = 0.90).
   We not only revealed that habitual coffee consumption is associated with higher adiponectin levels in Japanese males but also found a dose-dependent association between coffee consumption and adiponectin levels. Therefore, our study suggested that coffee components might play an important role in the elevation of adiponectin level.

AB Epidemiological data has associated coffee consumption with a lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and chronic liver disease. However, the mechanisms and coffee substances responsible for these effects remain unclear. In the present study, mice received caffeinated or decaffeinated instant coffee ad libitum during a two week period after inducing obesity by introducing a high-fat diet over a 10 week period. Body weight, glucose homeostasis, and liver and visceral adipose tissue inflammation were assessed. In addition, AKT signaling, the fatty acid profile and liver histopathological analyses were performed. Ingestion of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee for 2 weeks resulted in reductions in glucose and insulin blood levels, and insulin tolerance was improved without reductions in final body weight or adiposity. Only caffeinated coffee modified the adipokine profile in visceral adipose tissue, resulting in a restoration of adiponectin levels. However, deleterious liver alterations, which manifested as reductions in steatosis, inhibition of iNOS expression and restoration of insulin inducing-AKT phosphorylation, were reversed by the ingestion of both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. Serum AST and ALT levels were also improved in mice after coffee ingestion, while the fatty add profile in the liver and the cytokine profiles in adipose and liver tissues were not altered by coffee ingestion. Thus, instant coffee consumption reverses obesity-induced alterations in mice, and our results corroborate those of epidemiological studies that associated coffee consumption with a lower prevalence of obesity-related pathologies.

AB Coffee has been associated with reductions in the risk of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCCD), including diabetes mellitus. Because differences in food habits are recognizable modifying factors in the epidemiology of diabetes, we studied the association of coffee consumption with type-2 diabetes in a sample of the adult population of the Federal District, Brazil. This cross-sectional study was conducted by telephone interview (n = 1,440). A multivariate analysis was run controlling for socio-behavioural variables, obesity and family antecedents of NCCD. A hierarchical linear regression model and a Poisson regression were used to verify association of type-2 diabetes and coffee intake. The independent variables which remained in the final model, following the hierarchical inclusion levels, were: first level-age and marital status; second level-diabetes and dyslipidaemias in antecedents; third level-cigarette smoking, supplement intake, body mass index; and fourth level-coffee intake (<= 100 mL/d, 101 to 400 mL/day, and >400 mL/day). After adjusting hierarchically for the confounding variables, consumers of 100 to 400 mL of coffee/day had a 2.7% higher (p = 0.04) prevalence of not having diabetes than those who drank less than 100 mL of coffee/day. Compared to coffee intake of <= 100 mL/day, adults consuming >400 mL of coffee/day showed no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of diabetes. Thus, moderate coffee intake is favourably associated with self-reported type-2 diabetes in the studied population. This is the first study to show a relationship between coffee drinking and diabetes in a Brazilian population.

AB Context: Caffeine can stimulate insulin secretion by attenuating hyperglycemia in diabetes models with significant reduction of pancreatic functional beta cells. Knowledge of these mechanisms could contribute to new strategies for treating diabetes.
   Objective: This study evaluated the effects of caffeine and physical exercise on glycemic and insulin responses in diabetic rats.
   Materials and methods: The diabetes model was induced by intraperitoneal administration of 60 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ). Animals were divided into six groups: control, caffeine, STZ control, STZ caffeine, STZ sulfonylurea, and STZ caffeine + sulfonylurea. Acutely, control animals received 6 mg of caffeine and 10 mg/kg sulfonylurea or 10 mg/kg saline. Animals were sacrificed after physical exercise; blood samples were collected for glucose, glycerol, lactate, and insulin analyses. Cardiovascular responses were recorded before and after treatments. A one-way ANOVA and the post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls test were used to analyze statistical differences between treatments (p < 0.05).
   Results: About 6 mg/kg of caffeine did not alter cardiovascular responses, but promoted blood glucose reduction after 60 min of exercise when compared to animals in the control groups (387-187 mg/dL; p < 0.05). Insulin levels increased significantly (0.6-10 mu U/mL; p < 0.05) in rats that received acute caffeine treatment associated with sulfonylurea compared to rats in the other groups.
   Discussion and conclusion: Acute caffeine intake with exercise can increase glucose uptake enhancing insulin secretion stimulated by sulfonylurea in b cells-deficient pancreas. The results indicate the potential use of caffeine as a strategy for glycemic and insulin control in diabetes.

AB This review summarizes the published as well as unpublished human studies involving Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) extract and its primary protoalkaloid p-synephrine, providing information and an assessment of the safety and efficacy of these widely used products. The results of over 20 studies involving a total of approximately 360 subjects that consumed p-synephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients are reviewed and critiqued. Over 50% of the subjects involved in these studies were overweight/obese, and approximately two-thirds of these overweight/obese subjects consumed caffeine (132-528 mg/day) in conjunction with p-synephrine (10-53 mg/day). Bitter orange/p-synephrine containing products were consumed for up to 12 weeks. Approximately 44 % of the subjects consumed a bitter orange/p-synephrine only product, while the remainder consumed a complex product that contained multiple ingredients in addition to p-synephrine. In general, bitter orange extract alone (p-synephrine) or in combination with other herbal ingredients did not produce significant adverse events as an increase in heart rate or blood pressure, or alter electrocardiographic data, serum chemistry, blood cell counts or urinalysis. p-Synephrine alone as well as in combination products were shown to increase resting metabolic rate and energy expenditure, and modest increases in weight loss were observed with bitter orange extract/p-synephrine-containing products when given for six to 12 weeks. Longer term studies are needed to further assess the efficacy of these products and affirm their safety under these conditions.

AB Long-term ingestion of coffee polyphenols (chlorogenic acids, CGAs) reduces body fat in humans and rodents. While CGA supplementation has been shown to increase fat utilization in rodents, evidence in humans is still limited. The present study clarifies the effect of daily CGA consumption on energy metabolism in humans. Eighteen healthy male subjects (36.1 +/- 7.4 y of age) participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, intervention study with two different test beverages. The subjects consumed 185 mL of a test beverage with or without CGAs (329 mg) daily for 4 wk. The energy metabolism was evaluated by using indirect calorimetry before and after the test period during fasting and up to 180 min postprandially. Indirect calorimetry showed that a 4-wk ingestion of the CGA beverage led to a significantly higher postprandial energy expenditure than that of the control beverage. The subjects ingesting the CGA beverage exhibited higher postprandial fat utilization than those consuming the control beverage. The daily CGA consumption therefore increased postprandial fat utilization in healthy humans.

TI Effect of chronic coffee consumption on weight gain and glycaemia in a

AB OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological evidence shows that chronic coffee consumption in humans is correlated with a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. For the experimental exploration of the underlying mechanisms, this effect needs to be replicated in an animal model of type 2 diabetes with a short lifespan.
   DESIGN: Male C57BL/6 mice consumed regular coffee or water ad libitum and the development of obesity and diabetes caused by high-fat diet (55% lipids, HFD) was observed from week 10 on for 35 weeks in comparison with mice feeding on a defined normal diet (9% lipids, ND).
   RESULTS: The massive weight gain in HFD mice was dose-dependently retarded (P = 0.034), the moderate weight gain in ND mice was abolished (P<0.001) by coffee consumption, probably because of a lower feeding efficiency. The consumption of fluid (water or coffee) was significantly diminished by HFD (P<0.001), resulting in a higher coffee exposure of ND mice. On week 21 intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT) showed a dose-dependent faster decline of elevated glucose levels in coffee-consuming HFD mice (P = 0.016), but not in ND mice. Remarkably, a spontaneous decrease in non-fasting glycaemia occurred after week 21 in all treatment groups (P<0.001). On week 39 the IPGTT showed diminished peak of glucose levels in coffee-consuming HFD mice (P<0.05). HFD mice were hyperinsulinaemic and had significantly (P<0.001) enlarged islets. Coffee consumption did not affect islet size or parameters of beta-cell apoptosis, proliferation and insulin granule content.
   CONCLUSION: Coffee consumption retarded weight gain and improved glucose tolerance in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes and corresponding controls. This gives rise to the expectation that further insight into the mechanism of the diabetes-preventive effect of coffee consumption in humans may be gained by this approach.

AB Background: It is unclear whether consumption of coffee and green tea is associated with metabolic syndrome.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 554 adults who had participated in the baseline survey of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. Consumption of coffee and green tea was assessed using a questionnaire Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed using the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) and the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity (JASSO). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between consumption of coffee and green tea and prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components.
   Results: After adjustment for sex, age, and other potential confounders, greater coffee consumption was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome, as defined by NCEP ATP III criteria (P for trend = 0.03). Participants who drank more coffee had a lower odds ratio (OR) for high serum triglycerides (P for trend = 0.02), but not for increased waist circumference or high blood pressure. Using JASSO criteria, moderate coffee consumption (1.5 to < 3 cups/day) was associated with a significantly lower OR for high plasma glucose (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.93). Green tea consumption was not associated with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome or any of its components.
   Conclusions: Coffee consumption was inversely correlated with metabolic syndrome diagnosed using NCEP ATP III criteria, mainly because it was associated with lower serum triglyceride levels. This association highlights the need for further prospective studies of the causality of these relationships.

AB Objective. Previous studies have shown that coffee consumption is inversely related to serum levels of liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), but few have addressed the relation in women and effect modifications of alcohol use and obesity. We examined the association of coffee and green tea consumption with serum activities of liver enzymes in free-living Japanese men and women, focusing on sex difference and effect modifications of alcohol and obesity. Material and methods. The data were derived from the baseline survey of the Kyushu University Fukuoka Cohort Study, and included 12,020 Japanese men and women aged 49-76 years who were free of chronic liver diseases. Results. There was an inverse association between coffee consumption and elevated ALT in men, and the association between the two was weaker in women. In the analyses stratified by aminotransferases category, inverse associations of coffee consumption with serum activities of liver enzymes were observed in both men and women within the whole range and among those with aminotransferases within the reference range (ALT/AST < 40 IU/L for men and ALT/AST < 30 IU/L for women). Inverse associations of coffee with liver enzymes were more evident in those with high alcohol consumption and in those with low body mass index. Conclusions. Coffee drinking probably confers protection against alcohol-related increase in liver enzymes.

AB Background: The aim of the present study was to develop an alternative non-obese non-genetic rat model of type 2 diabetes (T2D).
   Methods: Six-week-old male SD rats were randomly divided into six groups, namely: Normal Control (NC), Diabetic Control (DBC), Caffeine 5 mg/kg BW + STZ (CAF5), Caffeine 10 mg/kg BW + STZ (CAF10), Caffeine 20 mg/kg BW + STZ (CAF20) and Caffeine 40 mg/kg BW + STZ (CAF40) and were fed a normal rat pellet diet and drinking water ad libitum throughout the experimental period. After a one week acclimatization period, diabetes was induced in the animals in DBC and all CAF groups with an injection (i.p.) of the respective dosages of caffeine (mg/kg BW) 15 min before the injection of STZ (65 mg/kg BW) when normal saline was injected to the DBC group instead of caffeine. The NC group received normal saline and buffer instead of caffeine and STZ, respectively. One week after the STZ injection, animals with non-fasting blood glucose >300 mg/dl were considered as diabetic. Three weeks after the STZ injection, the animals in the CAF5 and CAF10 groups were eliminated from the study due to the severity of diabetes and the experiment was continued with the remainder groups for a 13 weeks period.
   Results and conclusion: The data of food and fluid intake, body weight, blood glucose, glucose tolerance test, HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta, serum insulin, fructosamine, lipid profile and organ specific enzymes, antidiabetic drug response tests, and pancreatic histopathology suggest that CAF20 group can be a better alternative non-genetic model of non-obese T2D.

AB Numerous studies indicate that polyphenol-rich chocolate reduces fasting blood glucose, blood pressure (BP) and total cholesterol in healthy individuals and hypertensives with or without glucose intolerance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of two doses of polyphenol-rich dark chocolate (DC) on fasting capillary whole blood glucose, total cholesterol and BP and to examine whether improvements in these parameters are associated with changes in adrenocorticoid excretion in overweight and obese individuals. The study used a randomised, single-blind, cross-over design where fourteen overweight and obese subjects were randomised to either take 20 g DC with 500 mg polyphenols then 20 g DC with 1000 mg polyphenols or vice-versa. Participants followed each diet for 2 weeks separated by a 1-week washout period. It was observed that the 500 mg polyphenol dose was equally effective in reducing fasting blood glucose levels, systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) as the 1000 mg polyphenol dose suggesting that a saturation effect might occur with increasing dose of polyphenols. There was also a trend towards a reduction in urinary free cortisone levels with both groups although it did not reach statistical significance. No changes in anthropometrical measurements were seen. We suggest that more research is required to investigate the mechanism(s) by which polyphenol-rich foods influence health.

AB Dietary weight loss supplements include a wide range of ingredients. Many ingredients are derived from natural food sources such as green tea. This article presents the composition, mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety of green tea as a dietary aid to weight loss in overweight and obese adults. While green tea appears to promote energy expenditure and fat oxidation, safety concerns exist when it is consumed as a dietary supplement. Until more evidence-based research is conducted to determine which formulations and dosages are the safest and most effective, green tea should be used with caution as an aid for weight loss.

AB Combining an exercise and nutritional intervention is arguably the optimal method of creating energy imbalance for weight loss. This study sought to determine whether combining exercise and caffeine supplementation was more effective for promoting acute energy deficits and manipulations to substrate metabolism than exercise alone. Fourteen recreationally active participants (mean +/- SD body mass index: 22.7 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2)) completed a resting control trial (CON), a placebo exercise trial (EX), and a caffeine exercise trial (EX + CAF, 2 x 3 mg/kg of caffeine 90 min before and 30 min after exercise) in a randomized, double-blinded design. Trials were 4 h in duration with 1 h of rest, 1 h of cycling at similar to 65% power at maximum O-2 consumption or rest, and a 2-h recovery. Gas exchange, appetite perceptions, and blood samples were obtained periodically. Two hours after exercise, participants were offered an ad libitum test meal where energy and macronutrient intake were recorded. EX + CAF resulted in significantly greater energy expenditure and fat oxidation compared with EX (+ 250 kJ; + 10.4 g) and CON (+ 3,126 kJ; + 29.7 g) (P < 0.05). A trend for reduced energy and fat intake compared with CON (-718 kJ; -8 g) (P = 0.055) was observed. Consequently, EX + CAF created a greater energy deficit (P < 0.05). Caffeine also led to exercise being perceived as less difficult and more enjoyable (P < 0.05). Combining caffeine with exercise creates a greater acute energy deficit, and the implications of this protocol for weight loss or maintenance over longer periods of time in overweight/obese populations should be further investigated.

AB Mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St-Hil) is a native species of South America used to prepare traditional beverages. Recently a possible effect of its infusion on oxidative stress found in dyslipidemias has been reported. The main compounds related to these activities are phenolic compounds derived from chlorogenic acid. This study aimed to determine the anticholesteremic effect of the hydroethanolic extract (HEIP) and its n-butanolic fraction (n-BFIP), with standardized content of phenolic compounds derived from chlorogenic add, in rats treated with high-fat diet (HFD). The contents of these compounds in the ethanol extract and n-butanol fraction were respectively two and three times higher than in traditional infusion with predominance of dicaffeoylquinic derivatives. The extracts were able to reduce serum triglycerides and cholesterol and decrease the atherogenic index in treated animals. These results support a potential effect of the mate extract in cardiovascular disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The incidence of obesity is increasing rapidly worldwide. Identification of compounds that may decrease fat cell burden will be beneficial in the control of obesity. In the present study we investigated the effect of a combination of grape seed extarct, caffeine, genistein, and capsaicin (GCGC) in reducing body weight in obese male zucker rats. Rats were pair-fed on a high fat diet or high fat diet + GCGC for 5-weeks. GCGC caused a significant weight loss due to the depletion of fat depots. GCGC also improved insulin response, reduced plasma glucose and free fatty acids, and increased plasma adiponectin. Adipocytes from rats fed GCGC were more responsive to the various stimulators of lipolysis than the control adipocytes. These results show that a combination of plant-derived products is very effective in reducing body weight and improving insulin sensitivity and glucose response in obese zucker rats. This may have implications in the treatment of overweight and obesity in humans.

AB Confusion and controversy exist regarding the cardiovascular effects of dietary supplements containing caffeine and Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) extract. The primary protoalkaloidal ingredient in bitter orange extract is p-synephrine which has some structural similarities to ephedrine and nor-epinehrine, but exhibits markedly different pharmacokinetic and receptor binding properties. The goal of this study was to investigate the cardiovascular effects of a product containing caffeine, bitter orange extract (p-synephrine) and green tea extract in mildly overweight individuals. Fourteen female and nine male subjects (age 24.7 +/- 7.4 yrs, BMI: 26.6 +/- 3.8) volunteered in this randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, double-blind designed study. On day one, subjects entered the laboratory following an overnight fast. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at 60 min. Expired air was analyzed for the next 10 min of the session. At each of three meals, subjects ingested one capsule that was either a non-caloric placebo or a dietary supplement that contained 13 mg p-synephrine and 176 mg caffeine. On the following day, the subjects returned and repeated the protocol for data collection beginning 60 min after consuming one capsule of the placebo or the dietary supplement. No effects of the dietary supplement on heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure or mean arterial pressure were observed. No between or within group differences were observed when data were analyzed for gender and caffeine usage. A small but significant decrease in resting respiratory exchange ratio was observed for the low caffeine user group in response to the product containing caffeine and p-synephrine. The results of this study indicate that ingestion of a product containing bitter orange extract, caffeine and green tea extract does not lead to increased cardiovascular stress and that fat oxidation may increase in certain populations.

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a dietary supplementation with an extract from Cynara scolymus (Cs) on the glucose pattern in a group of patients with naive impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial has been performed in 55 overweight subjects with IFG (fasting blood glucose [FBG]: 6.11 +/- 0.56mmol/l). These subjects were randomly assigned to supplement their diet with either an extract from Cs (600mg/d) (26 subjects) or placebo (29 matched subjects) for 8 weeks. The decrease of FBG was the primary endpoint. The assessment of Homeostatic Metabolic Assessment (HOMA), glycosylated haemoglobin, A1c-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG), lipidic pattern and anthropometric parameters were the secondary endpoints. The within groups and percent changes from baseline were analyzed by the signed rank test. The comparison between groups was performed by Wilcoxon's two sample test. The supplemented group had significant decreases of: FBG (-9.6%), HOMA (-11.7%), glycosylated haemoglobin (-2.3%), ADAG (-3.1%) and lipidic pattern. The placebo group did not show any significant difference. Compared with the placebo, the supplemented group showed a significant difference in FBG, HOMA and lipidic pattern. These data demonstrate the efficacy of Cs extract on the reduction of glycometabolic parameters in overweight subjects with IFG. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective. Higher coffee and green tea consumption has been suggested to decrease risk of type 2 diabetes, but their roles in insulin resistance (IR) and insulin secretion remain unclear. This study examined the association between habitual consumption of these beverages and markers of glucose metabolism in a Japanese working population.
   Materials/Methods. Participants were 1440 Japanese employees (1151 men and 289 women) aged 18-69 years. Consumption of coffee and green tea was ascertained via a validated brief diet history questionnaire. Multilevel linear regression was used to estimate means (95% confidence intervals) of fasting insulin, fasting plasma glucose, homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), homeostatic model assessment of 3-cell function (HOMA-beta) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with adjustment for potential confounding variables.
   Results. Coffee consumption was significantly, inversely associated with HOMA-IR (P for trend = 0.03), and the association appeared to be confined to overweight subjects (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)) (P for trend = 0.01, P for interaction = 0.08). Unexpectedly, green tea consumption was positively associated with HOMA-IR (P for trend = 0.02), though there was no dose-response relationship among daily consumers of green tea. Neither coffee nor green tea consumption was associated with HOMA-beta and HbA1c.
   Conclusions. Our findings indicate that coffee consumption may be associated with decreased IR, but not with insulin secretion. The positive association between green tea consumption and IR warrants further investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aims of the following experiments were to characterize antidiabetic in vitro and in vivo activity of the polyphenol-rich aqueous extract of Rutgers Scarlet Lettuce (RSL).
   Methods: RSL extract (RSLE) and isolated compounds were evaluated for inhibitory effects on glucose production as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha-dependent inhibition of insulin activity in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. Additionally, high-fat diet-induced obese mice were treated with RSLE (100 or 300 mg/kg), metformin (250 mg/kg), or vehicle (water) for 28 d by oral administration and insulin and oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted. Tissues were harvested at the end of the study and evaluated for biochemical and physiological improvements in metabolic syndrome conditions.
   Results: A polyphenol-rich RSLE, containing chlorogenic acid, cyanidin malonyl-glucoside, and quercetin malonyl-glucoside, was produced by simple boiling water extraction at pH 2.0. In vitro, RSLE and chlorogenic acid demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of glucose production. In vivo, RSLE treatment improved glucose metabolism measured by oral glucose tolerance tests, but not insulin tolerance tests. RSLE treated groups had a lower ratio of liver weight to body weight as well as decreased total liver lipids compared with the control group after 28 d of treatment. No significant differences in plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and triglycerides were observed with RSLE-treated groups compared with vehicle control.
   Conclusion: RSLE demonstrated antidiabetic effects in vitro and in vivo and may improve metabolic syndrome conditions of fatty liver and glucose metabolism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the effects of mate tea (Ilex paraguariensis) aqueous extract consumption on metabolic indicators and inflammatory response of peritoneal macrophages in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Male Wistar rats were fed a control diet or a HFD for 12 weeks. At the end of this period, rats received, or not, daily doses of yerba mate for 4 weeks. The consumption of yerba mate promoted weight loss, attenuated the HFD-detrimental effects on adiposity and insulin sensitivity and decreased blood levels of the inflammatory biomarkers (p < 0.05). Concerning peritoneal macrophages, mate tea consumption decreased the production of interleukin (IL)-6, but did not influence the production of IL-1 beta, tumour necrosis factor-a and nitric oxide; cytokine mRNA expression; or the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B signalling pathway. In summary, the consumption of mate tea had no consistent effect in the inflammatory response of peritoneal macrophages, but reduced cardiometabolic risk markers.

AB It is well known that tea has a variety of beneficial impacts on human health, including anti-obesity effects. It is well documented that green tea and its constituent catechins suppress obesity, but the effects of other types of tea on obesity and the potential mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated the suppression of adiposity by oolong, black and pu-erh tea and characterized the underlying molecular mechanism in vivo. We found that the consumption of oolong, black or pu-erh tea for a period of one week significantly decreased visceral fat without affecting body weight in male ICR mice. On a mechanistic level, the consumption of tea enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in white adipose tissue (WAT). This was accompanied by the induction of WAT protein levels of uncoupling protein 1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1. Our results indicate that oolong, black and pu-erh tea, and in particular, black tea, suppresses adiposity via phosphorylation of the key metabolic regulator AMPK and increases browning of WAT.

AB There is increasing evidence that tea and its non-caffeine components (primarily flavonoids)contribute to cardiovascular health. Randomized controlled trials have shown that tea can improve cardiovascular disease risk factors. We have previously reported a non-caffeine associated beneficial effect of regular black tea consumption on blood pressure and its variation. Objective: To explore the non-caffeine associated effects of black tea on body weight and body fat distribution, and cardiovascular disease related metabolic outcomes. Design: regular tea-drinking men and women (n = 111; BMI 20-35 kg m(-2)) were recruited to a randomized controlled double-blind 6 month parallel-designed trial. Participants consumed 3 cups per day of either powdered black tea solids (tea) or a flavonoid-free flavour-and caffeine-matched placebo (control). Body weight, waist-and hip-circumference, endothelial function and plasma biomarkers were assessed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Results: Compared to control, regular ingestion of black tea over 3 months inhibited weight gain (-0.64 kg, p = 0.047) and reduced waist circumference (-1.88 cm, P = 0.035) and waist-to-hip ratio (-0.03, P = 0.005). These effects were no longer significant at 6 months. There were no significant effects observed on fasting glucose, insulin, plasma lipids or endothelial function. Conclusion: Our study suggests that short-term regular ingestion of black tea over 3 months can improve body weight and body fat distribution, compared to a caffeine-matched control beverage. However, there was no evidence that these effects were sustained beyond 3 months.

AB Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is a highly popular herbal beverage in South America due to its high content of caffeine. Its hypolipidemic and antioxidant properties are of increasing interest in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders and for weight control. In the present study, we show for the first time both the local and systemic anti-inflammatory effects of an aqueous extract of mate in three classic in vivo models, namely acute and chronic 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetateinduced mouse ear edema and acute carrageenan-induced mouse paw edema. Caffeine, rutin, chlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicafeoyl quinic acid, and 4,5-dicafeoyl quinic acid, accompanied by a complex mixture of other simple phenolic acids, were identified in the extract by HPLC-UV analyses. In the acute edema model, mate extract applied topically (1mg/ear) halved the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced acute edema (50%) and almost suppressed neutrophil infiltration (93%), while in the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced subchronic inflammation, the edema was significantly reduced by 62% (1mg/ear/day x seven doses). The oral administration of the mate extract (250 mg/kg) significantly reduced the carrageenan-induced edema at all time points, an effect which was accompanied by a 43% and 53% reduction of the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, respectively. Histological analyses confirmed a reduction of epithelium thickness, dermis with mild inflammation, hair follicles with some secretory cells of sebaceous glands, and hypodermic adipocytes. In conclusion, mate is endowed with in vivo preventative or therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects in both local and systemic inflammatory processes.

AB Background: Caffeinated beverages are widely consumed among women of reproductive age, but their association with reproductive hormones, and whether race modifies any such associations, is not well understood.
   Objective: We assessed the relation between caffeine and caffeinated beverage intake and reproductive hormones in healthy premenopausal women and evaluated the potential effect modification by race.
   Design: Participants (n = 259) were followed for up to 2 menstrual cycles and provided fasting blood specimens for hormonal assessment at up to 8 visits per cycle and four 24-h dietary recalls per cycle. Weighted linear mixed models and nonlinear mixed models with harmonic terms were used to estimate associations between caffeine and hormone concentrations, adjusted for age, adiposity, physical activity, energy and alcohol intakes, and perceived stress. On the basis of a priori assumptions, an interaction between race and caffeine was tested, and stratified results are presented.
   Results: Caffeine intake >= 200 mg/d was inversely associated with free estradiol concentrations among white women (beta = -0.15; 95% CI: -0.26, -0.05) and positively associated among Asian women (beta = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.92). Caffeinated soda intake and green tea intake >= 1 cup/d (1 cup = 240 mL) were positively associated with free estradiol concentrations among all races: beta = 0.14 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.22) and beta = 0.26 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.45), respectively.
   Conclusions: Moderate consumption of caffeine was associated with reduced estradiol concentrations among white women, whereas caffeinated soda and green tea intakes were associated with increased estradiol concentrations among all races. Further research is warranted on the association between caffeine and caffeinated beverages and reproductive hormones and whether these relations differ by race. Am J Clin Nutr 2012;95:488-97.

AB IQP-GC-101 is a patented blend of the standardized extracts of Garcinia cambogia, Camellia sinensis, unroasted Coffea arabica, and Lagerstroemia speciosa. These individual ingredients of IQP-GC-101 have each shown promise in promoting weight loss; however, the efficacy of the blend has not been established. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study conducted over 14weeks (including a 2-week run-in phase) aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of IQP-GC-101 in reducing body weight and body fat mass in overweight Caucasian adults. Subjects took three IQP-GC-101 or placebo tablets, twice a day, 30min before main meals. All subjects also adhered to a 500kcal/day energy deficit diet with 30% of energy from fat. Ninety-one overweight and mildly obese subjects (46 in the IQP-GC-101 group, 45 in the placebo group) completed the study. After 12-week intervention, IQP-GC-101 resulted in a mean (+/- SD) weight loss of 2.26 +/- 2.37kg compared with 0.56 +/- 2.34kg for placebo (p(U)=0.002). There was also significantly more reduction in body fat mass, waist circumference, and hip circumference in the IQP-GC-101 group. No serious adverse events were reported. The use of IQP-GC-101 has been shown to result in body weight and body fat reduction in the current study, with good tolerability. (c) 2014 InQpharm Group Sdn Bhd.

AB The recent advancements in unraveling novel mechanisms that control the induction, (trans) differentiation, proliferation, and thermogenic activity and capacity of brown adipose tissue (BAT), together with the application of imaging techniques for human BAT visualization, have generated optimism that these advances will provide novel strategies for targeting BAT thermogenesis, leading to efficacious and safe obesity therapies. This paper first provides an overview of landmark events of the past few decades that have been driving the search for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical compounds that would increase BAT thermogenesis for obesity management. It then addresses issues about what could be expected from an ideal thermogenic antiobesity approach, in particular to what extent daily energy expenditure will need to increase in order to achieve long-term weight loss currently achievable only through bariatric surgery, and whether the human body will have enough thermogenic capacity to reach this target weight loss by future therapies focused on BAT.

AB Background: Since ephedra-containing dietary supplements were banned from the US market, manufacturers changed their formulations by eliminating ephedra and replacing with other botanicals, including Citrus aurantium, or bitter orange. Bitter orange contains, among other compounds, synephrine, a chemical that is chemically similar to ephedrine. Since ephedrine may have cardiovascular effects, the goal of this study was to investigate the cardiovascular effects of various doses of bitter orange extract and pure synephrine in rats.
   Method: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed daily by gavage for 28 days with synephrine from two different extracts. One extract contained 6% synephrine, and the other extract contained 95% synephrine. Doses were 10 or 50 mg synephrine/kg body weight from each extract. Additionally, caffeine was added to these doses, since many dietary supplements also contain caffeine. Telemetry was utilized to monitor heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and QT interval in all rats.
   Results and conclusion: Synephrine, either as the bitter orange extract or as pure synephrine, increased heart rate and blood pressure. Animals treated with 95% synephrine showed minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure; more significant effects were observed with the bitter orange extract suggesting that other components in the botanical can alter these physiological parameters. The increases in heart rate and blood pressure were more pronounced when caffeine was added. None of the treatments affected uncorrected QT interval in the absence of caffeine.

AB Green tea catechins (GTC) are polyphenolic compounds present in the unfermented dried leaves of the plant, Camellia sinensis. Results from a number of randomized, controlled intervention trials have shown that consumption of GTC (270 mg to 1200 mg/day) may reduce body weight and fat. There are several proposed mechanisms whereby GTC may influence body weight and composition. The predominating hypothesis is that GTC influences sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, increasing energy expenditure and promoting the oxidation of fat. Caffeine, naturally present in green tea, also influences SNS activity, and may act synergistically with GTC to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Other potential mechanisms include modifications in appetite, up-regulation of enzymes involved in hepatic fat oxidation, and decreased nutrient absorption. This article reviews the evidence for each of these purported mechanisms, with particular reference to studies in humans. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To evaluate the preference of healthy and unhealthy foods among pre-school children attending day-care and its association with that of their parents, body mass index and socio-demographic variables. Methodology: We asked children and parents to depict their food preferences through 54 pictures of different food items. The association between the preferences and socio-demographic variables was done using the Phi correlation, chi-squared, Fisher's correlation, as well as univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Two-hundred and sixty-five parent-child pairs participated in the study. Ice cream, potato chips and lollypops were the foods most preferred by children. On the other hand, quince jelly, coffee and avocado were the least preferred. Overweight and obese children had a higher preference for quince jelly, preserved fruits, and vegetable soup. With univariate logistic regression, children of low-income homes (OR= 2.56, p=0.007) and attending public daycare centers (OR= 6.2, p=0.0001) preferred less healthy fruits. When the father's education was added in a multivariable model including family income, only children whose fathers had <= 9 years of education showed a higher preference for less healthy food. When parent's education, family income, and parent's preference for healthy foods were included to the model only children attending public daycares were more likely to prefer healthy foods. Conclusion: The foods most preferred by children have a high caloric density. The children's body mass index, their parent's monthly income, the father's education and the type of daycare they attended were associated with the preference of healthy or unhealthy foods.

AB Overweight and obesity have become a global epidemic and they may impair health. Traditional use and growing evidence indicate that mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.) may be helpful in losing excessive weight and fat. The present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated efficacy and safety of an extract from green mate in 60 overweight subjects aged 20-39 years during 6-weeks. Body composition was measured by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) at baseline and after 6 weeks. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and various safety parameters were monitored. After 6 weeks, subjects taking mate experienced a significantly greater reduction of percent of body fat (-0.3% vs. +0.6%, p = 0.04) and fat mass (-0.5 kg vs. +0.2 kg, p = 0.04) than placebo. No significant differences were observed in other measurements. No adverse events occurred and all safety parameters were within normal ranges during the study in both groups. Thus, taking green mate extract reduced body fat after 6 weeks, while the treatment was safe and well tolerated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB p-Synephrine is an adrenergic amine found in Citrus aurantium L. fruits and has been used for weight loss in dietary supplements. There are commercial products containing this substance associated to caffeine, salicin, and ephedrine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of this mixture in mice of both sexes. The significative results observed after acute oral administration to male and female mice of 300, 350, and 400 mg/kg total of p-synephrine, ephedrine, salicin, plus caffeine in a 10:4:6:80 w/w ratio included a reduction in locomotor activity and ptosis in all treated groups for both sexes. Seizures were also observed in male (400 mg/kg) and female groups (350 and 400 mg/kg). Gasping and tearing were observed in males. Salivation (400 mg/kg), agitation (350 and 400 mg/kg), and piloerection (all treated groups) were significantly observed only in females. Deaths occurred in males at 350 and 400 mg/kg treated groups and the necropsy showed cardiopulmonary hemorrhage. A reduction in locomotor activity was confirmed through the spontaneous locomotor activity test, in which the number of crossings considerably decreased (P < .01) in all treated groups. The rotarod test showed a decrease in motor coordination at 400 mg/kg. Body temperature decreased significantly (P < .01) in all treated groups compared to controls. The results suggested clear signs of toxicity of p-synephrine, ephedrine, salicin, and caffeine association; this toxicity augments the attentiveness on commercial products containing this mixture, given the expressive number of adverse events related to its utilization.

AB Associations between food and beverage groups and the risk of diet-related chronic disease (DRCD) have been the subject of intensive research in preventive nutrition. Pooled/meta-analyses and systematic reviews (PMASRs) aim to better characterize these associations. To date, however, there has been no attempt to synthesize all PMASRs that have assessed the relationship between food and beverage groups and DRCDs. The objectives of this review were to aggregate PMASRs to obtain an overview of the associations between food and beverage groups (n = 17) and DRCDs (n = 10) and to establish new directions for future research needs. The present review of 304 PMASRs published between 1950 and 2013 confirmed that plant food groups are more protective than animal food groups against DRCDs. Within plant food groups, grain products are more protective than fruits and vegetables. Among animal food groups, dairy/milk products have a neutral effect on the risk of DRCDs, while red/processed meats tend to increase the risk. Among beverages, tea was the most protective and soft drinks the least protective against DRCDs. For two of the DRCDs examined, sarcopenia and kidney disease, no PMASR was found. Overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, and various types of cardiovascular disease and cancer accounted for 289 of the PMASRs. There is a crucial need to further study the associations between food and beverage groups and mental health, skeletal health, digestive diseases, liver diseases, kidney diseases, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.

AB Aims: Cumulative evidence suggests that coffee consumption may have beneficial effects on metabolic diseases; however, few previous studies have considered the types of coffee consumed and the additives used. We investigated the relationship between coffee consumption and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) and its components.
   Methods: We analyzed 17,953 Korean adults, aged 19-65 years, using cross-sectional data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES, 2007-2011). Coffee consumption level, types of coffee consumed, and the additives used were assessed based on a food frequency questionnaire and 24-h recall. Demographic and lifestyle factors were assessed using self-administered questionnaires. Data on metabolic biomarkers were obtained from a health examination. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratios of prevalent metabolic syndrome and its components according to frequency and type of coffee consumption.
   Results: We found that 76% of the subjects were habitual coffee drinkers, most of whom consumed instant coffee mix containing sugar and powder creamer. After multivariable adjustment, the odds ratios (95% CI) comparing those who consumed coffee >= 3 times/day with those who consumed coffee <1 time/week were 1.37 (1.15-1.63) for obesity, 1.33 (1.11-1.59) for abdominal obesity, 1.28 (1.09-1.51) for hypo-HDL cholesterolemia, and 1.37 (1.10-1.72) for metabolic syndrome. Instant-coffee drinkers were observed to have elevated risks of these metabolic conditions.
   Conclusions: Consumption of coffee, particularly instant coffee mix, may have harmful effects on MetSyn, perhaps partly deriving from excessive intake of sugar and powder creamer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.D

AB Epidemiologic findings offer the promise that coffee or its many constituents may be useful as a dietary intervention in type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention. We aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the ameliorative effects of caffeinated coffee (CC), decaffeinated coffee (DC) and unroasted caffeinated green coffee (GC) on skeletal muscle gene expression profiles and their relationships in an obesity animal model. Eight-week-old male C57BL6 mice were raised for 9 weeks ad libitum on a normal diet, a high-fat diet, or high-fat diet containing 2 % freeze-dried CC, or DC, or GC. Total RNA and protein were extracted from skeletal muscle and subjected to microarray (Mouse Genome 430 2.0, Affymetrix) and western blotting analyses, respectively. Coffee intake mitigated the insulin resistance by decreasing plasma glucose levels during an insulin tolerance test and by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), p85/IRS-1 complex and pAkt/PKB (protein kinase B). In addition, coffee intake down-regulated the anti-inflammatory genes activating transcription factor 3, FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene, heat shock protein 1A, heat shock protein 1B and synuclein, gamma and the inflammation-associated insulin signaling genes stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 and secreted phosphoprotein 1. These results provide scientific insight on the probable positive effects of coffee intake on impaired insulin signaling, inflammation and obesity, thereby providing a new perspective on the prevention of obesity and T2D.

AB Different outcomes of the effect of catechin-caffeine mixtures and caffeine-only supplementation on energy expenditure and fat oxidation have been reported in short-term studies. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to elucidate whether catechin-caffeine mixtures and caffeine-only supplementation indeed increase thermogenesis and fat oxidation. First, English-language studies measuring daily energy expenditure and fat oxidation by means of respiration chambers after catechin-caffeine mixtures and caffeine-only supplementation were identified through PubMed. Six articles encompassing a total of 18 different conditions fitted the inclusion criteria. Second, results were aggregated using random/mixed-effects models and expressed in terms of the mean difference in 24 h energy expenditure and fat oxidation between the treatment and placebo conditions. Finally, the influence of moderators such as BMI and dosage on the results was examined as well. The catechin-caffeine mixtures and caffeine-only supplementation increased energy expenditure significantly over 24 h (428.0 kJ (4.7%); P < 0.001 and 429.1 kJ (4.8%); P < 0.001, respectively). However, 24 h fat oxidation was only increased by catechin-caffeine mixtures (12.2 g (16.0%); P < 0.02 and 9.5 g (12.4%); P = 0.11, respectively). A dose-response effect on 24 h energy expenditure and fat oxidation occurred with a mean increase of 0.53 kJ mg(-1) (P < 0.01) and 0.02 g mg(-1) (P < 0.05) for catechin-caffeine mixtures and 0.44 kJ mg(-1) (P < 0.001) and 0.01 g mg(-1) (P < 0.05) for caffeine-only. In conclusion, catechin-caffeine mixtures or a caffeine-only supplementation stimulates daily energy expenditure dose-dependently by 0.4-0.5 kJ mg(-1) administered. Compared with placebo, daily fat-oxidation was only significantly increased after catechin-caffeine mixtures ingestion.

AB Background: The present study investigated the effects of a multi-ingredient dietary supplement (MIDS) containing caffeine, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), green tea, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) taken for 8 weeks on body composition, blood lipid profile, glucose, insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in overweight and obese men and women.
   Methods: Twenty-two participants completed the study (PL, n = 11; 7 women, 4 men; age, 34 +/- 3.5 years; height, 169.2 +/- 3.3 cm; body mass, 96.9 +/- 6.8 kg; BMI, 34.1 +/- 1.8 kg/m(2); MIDS, n = 11; 9 women, 2 men; age, 36 +/- 3.4 years; height, 173.2 +/- 2.9 cm; body mass, 91.9 +/- 5.6 kg; BMI, 30.0 +/- 1.5 kg/m(2)). Participants were randomly assigned and stratified by body fat percentage to two groups: 1) a soybean oil placebo (PL) or 2) MIDS. Each group consumed two pills with breakfast and two pills with lunch. Body composition and android fat, waist and hip circumferences, blood pressure and heart rate were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of supplementation.
   Results: There were no significant changes for any of the variables of body composition. Feelings of hunger were significantly higher in MIDS versus PL with no changes observed in satiety or desire to eat. Heart rate and blood pressure were unaltered in MIDS after 8 weeks of supplementation. Furthermore, lipid profile, food intake, mood state variables, fasting blood glucose, and endocrine markers did not significantly change regardless of group.
   Conclusion: MIDS intake does not appear to alter body composition or markers of cardiovascular health versus PL. Moreover, MIDS may actually increase feelings of hunger versus PL.

ID ADENOSINE RECEPTORS; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; FAT; CONSUMPTION
AB Objective: Caffeine is a constituent of many non-alcoholic beverages. Pharmacological actions of caffeine include the antagonism of adenosine receptors and the inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity. The A(1) adenosine receptors present on adipocytes are involved in the control of fatty acid uptake and lipolysis. In this study, the effects of caffeine were characterized in a diet-induced metabolic syndrome in rats.
   Methods: Rats were given a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (mainly containing fructose and beef tallow) for 16 wk. The control rats were given a corn starch diet. Treatment groups were given caffeine 0.5 g/kg of food for the last 8 wk of the 16-wk protocol. The structure and function of the heart and the liver were investigated in addition to the metabolic parameters including the plasma lipid components.
   Results: The high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet induced symptoms of metabolic syndrome, including obesity, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, and increased systolic blood pressure, associated with the development of cardiovascular remodeling and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The treatment with caffeine in the rats fed the high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet decreased body fat and systolic blood pressure, improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and attenuated cardiovascular and hepatic abnormalities, although the plasma lipid concentrations were further increased.
   Conclusion: Decreased total body fat, concurrent with increased plasma lipid concentrations, reflects the lipolytic effects of caffeine in adipocytes, likely owing to the caffeine antagonism of A1 adenosine receptors on ad ipocytes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   FREQUENCY
AB Background and Aim: Recently, considerable attention has been given to beverage intake as a source of calories which may be linked to pediatric obesity. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the beverage intake in school children and adolescents aged 7 to 15 years old.
   Methods: Six hundred and seven (607) out of 655 children participated in the study. One hundred percent fruit juice were classified those beverages that contain 100% fruit juice, without sweetener. Sweetened sugar beverages (SSBs) were included (fruit drinks sweetened fruit juice, fruit-flavored drink or drink that contained fruit juice in part, sweeten soft drinks, coffee, and tea).
   Results: Around 84% of subjects consumed water while 81% of children who were included in the analysis consumed milk, 49.5% consumed 100% fruit juice, and 79.4 % SSBs. Whole milk was consumed by 40.9% of school children. Skim milk and 1% milk were consumed by 3.6% and 4.7% of the children, respectively. Children and adolescents consuming SSBs were 2.57 (95% CI: 1.06, 3.38) times more likely to become obese compared to normal peers.
   Conclusion: Sugar beverage drinks but not 100% fruit juices and milk are associated with obesity. Further studies investigating the relationship among beverage consumption, total energy intake, and development of overweight are needed.

AB Background/Objectives: Caffeine is a mildly addictive psychoactive chemical and controversial additive to sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The objective of this study is to assess if removal of caffeine from SSBs allows co-removal of sucrose (energy) without affecting flavour of SSBs, and if removal of caffeine could potentially affect population weight gain.
   Subjects/Methods: The research comprised of three studies; study 1 used three-alternate forced choice and paired comparison tests to establish detection thresholds for caffeine in water and sucrose solution (subjects, n = 63), and to determine if caffeine suppressed sweetness. Study 2 (subjects, n = 30) examined the proportion of sucrose that could be co-removed with caffeine from SSBs without affecting the flavour of the SSBs. Study 3 applied validated coefficients to estimate the impact on the weight of the United States population if there was no caffeine in SSBs.
   Results: Detection threshold for caffeine in water was higher (1.09 +/- 0.08 mM) than the detection threshold for caffeine in sucrose solution (0.49 +/- 0.04 mM), and a paired comparison test revealed caffeine significantly reduced the sweetness of sucrose (P<0.001). Removing caffeine from SSBs allowed co-removal of 10.3% sucrose without affecting flavour of the SSBs, equating to 116 kJ per 500 ml serving. The effect of this on body weight in adults and children would be 0.600 and 0.142 kg, which are equivalent to 2.08 and 1.10 years of observed existing trends in weight gain, respectively.
   Conclusion: These data suggest the extra energy in SSBs as a result of caffeine's effect on sweetness may be associated with adult and child weight gain. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011) 65, 1338-1344; doi:10.1038/ejcn.2011.123; published online 20 July 2011

AB Crystals of the complexes of (+)-catechin (CA) of non-galloylated catechin and (-)-catechin-3-O-gallate (Cg) of galloylated catechin with caffeine were prepared, and their stereochemical structures and intermolecular interactions were determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. CA formed a 1:1 complex with caffeine by intermolecular hydrogen bonds, whereas Cg formed a 1: 2 complex with caffeine, which was formed by face-to-face and offset pi-pi interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. A solution of two kinds of non-galloylated catechin, CA and (-)-epicatechin (EC), and caffeine (molar ratio 1 :1 : 2) in water afforded a 1 :1 : 2 complex, the crystal structure of which had two layers, one layer in which CA and caffeine formed alternate lines and an other layer in which EC and caffeine formed alternate lines. The 1 :1 : 2 complex was formed by offset pi-pi and CH-pi interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

AB Objective: The objective of this study is to examine associations of proximity to food establishments with body mass index (BMI) among preschool-age children.
   Methods: We used baseline data from 438 children ages 2-6.9 years with a BMI >= 85th percentile participating in a RCT in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2009. We used a geographic information system to determine proximity to six types of food establishments: 1) convenience stores, 2) bakeries, coffee shops, candy stores, 3) full service restaurants, 4) large supermarkets, 5) small supermarkets, and 6) fast-food restaurants. The main outcome was child's BMI.
   Results: Children's mean (SD) BMI was 19.2 (2.4) kg/m(2); 35% lived <= 1 mile from a large supermarket, 42% lived > 1 to 2 miles, and 22% lived > 2 miles. Compared to children living > 2 miles from a large supermarket, those who lived within I mile had a BMI 1.06 kg/m(2) higher. Adjustment for socioeconomic characteristics and distance to fast-food restaurants attenuated this estimate to 0.77 kg/m(2). Living in any other distance category from a large supermarket and proximity to other food establishments were not associated with child BMI.
   Conclusions: Living closer to a large supermarket was associated with higher BMI among preschool-age children who were overweight or obese. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Low calorie diets are always difficult for obese subjects to follow and lead to metabolic and behavioral adaptation. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of caffeine treatment with calorie shifting diet (CSD) on weight loss. Female subjects (n=60; BMI > 25) completed 4-weeks control diet, 6-weeks CSD (3 repeated phases; each 2-weeks) and 4-weeks follow-up diet, with or without caffeine treatment (5 mg/Kg/day). The first 11 days of each phase included calorie restriction with four meals every day and 4 hours intervals. Significant weight and fat loss were observed after 4-weeks of CSD (5.7 +/- 1.24 Kg and 4.84 +/- 1.53 Kg) or CSD+Caffeine (7.57 +/- 2.33 Kg and 5.24 +/- 2.07 Kg) which was consistent for one month of the follow-up (CSD: 5.24 +/- 1.83 Kg and 4.3 +/- 1.62 Kg, CSD+ Caffeine: 12.11 +/- 2.31 Kg and 9.85 +/- 1.6 Kg, p < 0.05 vs CSD group) and correlated to the restricted energy intake (p < 0.05). During three CSD phases, RMR tended to remain unchanged in both groups. While, CSD or CSD + Caffeine treatments, significantly decreased plasma glucose, total-cholesterol, and triacylglycerol (p < 0.05), even during follow-up period (p < 0.05). HDL-cholesterol was not changed by CSD. Feeling of hunger decreased and subject's satisfaction increased after 4-weeks of CSD (p < 0.05) and remained low to the end of study, while satiety was not affected. Coffeine increased the effect of CSD on feeling of hunger and subject's satisfaction after week 7 (p < 0.05 vs. CSD).
   These findings indicated that combination of caffeine treatment with CSD could be an effective alternative approach to weight and fat loss with small changes in RMR and improved tolerance of subjects to the new diet.

J Appl Physiol 111: 1629-1636, 2011. First published September 22, 2011; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00249.2011.-Caffeine decreases insulin sensitivity and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle; however, the precise mechanism responsible for this deleterious effect is not understood fully. We investigated the effects of incubation with caffeine on insulin signaling in rat epitrochlearis muscle. Caffeine (>= 1 mM, >= 15 min) suppressed insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 Tyr(612) phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These responses were associated with inhibition of the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) Tyr(458), Akt Ser(473), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta Ser(9) and with inhibition of insulin-stimulated 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3MG) transport but not with inhibition of the phosphorylation of insulin receptor-beta Tyr(1158/62/63). Furthermore, caffeine enhanced phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser(307) and an IRS-1 Ser(307) kinase, inhibitor-kappa B kinase (IKK)-alpha/beta Ser(176/180). Blockade of IKK/IRS-1 Ser(307) by caffeic acid ameliorated the caffeine-induced downregulation of IRS-1 Tyr(612) phosphorylation and 3MG transport. Caffeine also increased the phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser(789) and an IRS-1 Ser(789) kinase, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, inhibition of IRS-1 Ser(789) and AMPK phosphorylation by dantrolene did not rescue the caffeine-induced downregulation of IRS-1 Tyr(612) phosphorylation or 3MG transport. In addition, caffeine suppressed the phosphorylation of insulin-stimulated IRS-1 Ser(636/639) and upstream kinases, including the mammalian target of rapamycin and p70S6 kinase. Intravenous injection of caffeine at a physiological dose (5 mg/kg) in rats inhibited the phosphorylation of insulin-stimulated IRS-1 Tyr(612) and Akt Ser(473) in epitrochlearis muscle. Our results indicate that caffeine inhibits insulin signaling partly through the IKK/IRS-1 Ser(307) pathway, via a Ca2+- and AMPK-independent mechanism in skeletal muscle.

AB We previously reported that a 7 day ingestion of caffeinated green tea extract (cGTE) induced marked metabolic differences during rest and exercise. Here, we report the metabolic effects of 1, 7, and 28 day ingestions of decaffeinated GTE (dGTE). In this crossover placebo-controlled study, 19 healthy males ingested dGTE or placebo (PLA) for 28 days, separated by a 28 day wash-out period. On days 1, 7, and 28, participants completed a 30 min cycling exercise 2 h after the ingestion of dGTE or PLA. Blood samples were collected at rest (t = 0 and 120 min) and during exercise (t = 150 min). Plasma was analyzed using untargeted four-phase metabolite profiling and targeted profiling of catecholamines and catechins. dGTE abolished several metabolic effects when compared to our previous study with cGTE. However, following 7 and 28 day dGTE ingestions, increases in 3-hydroxybutyrate, a metabolic marker of fat oxidation, were observed at t = 0 min. dGTE ingestion did not induce significant acute or acute-on-chronic effects on endogenous metabolites just prior to and during exercise.

AB The merits and demerits of food with health claims for the prevention of metabolic syndrome (MS) are reviewed. One major underlying cause of MS is obesity. Diet and lifestyle changes remain the cornerstones of therapy for obesity, but resulting weight loss is often small and long-term success is extremely uncommon and disappointing. Many anti-obesity drugs have been associated with unintended therapeutic outcomes. Currently, only one drug (mazindol) is approved in Japan for short-term treatment of individuals with a BMI over 35 kg/m(2). Treatment with orlistat with dietary modification, caffeine, or protein supplementation; consuming a low-fat diet; adherence to physical activity routines; prolonged contact with participants; problem-solving therapy; and the alternative treatment of acupressure are efficacious in reducing weight regain after weight loss treatment. Because obesity is highly stigmatized, any effective treatment should be made available to improve quality of life and self-image. Therefore, it is necessary to provide information to consumers through the media concerning 1) basic knowledge about health foods and laws concerning them, 2) scientifically based information on safety/effectiveness of health foods and food elements, and 3) reports on health disturbances associated with health foods around the world.

AB Background: Green tea catechins (GTCs) with or without caffeine have been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for their effect on anthropometric measures and have yielded conflicting results.
   Objective: The objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of GTCs on anthropometric variables, including body mass index (BMI), body weight, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).
   Design: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database was conducted through April 2009. RCTs that evaluated GTCs with or without caffeine and that reported BMI, body weight, WC, or WHR were included. The weighted mean difference of change from baseline (with 95% CIs) was calculated by using a random-effects model.
   Results: Fifteen studies (n = 1243 patients) met the inclusion criteria. On meta-analysis, GTCs with caffeine decreased BMI (-0.55; 95% CI: -0.65, -0.40), body weight (-1.38 kg; 95% CI: -1.70, -1.06), and WC (-1.93 cm; 95% CI: -2.82, -1.04) but not WHR compared with caffeine alone. GTC ingestion with caffeine also significantly decreased body weight (-0.44 kg; 95% CI: -0.72, -0.15) when compared with a caffeine-free control. Studies that evaluated GTCs without concomitant caffeine administration did not show benefits on any of the assessed anthropometric endpoints.
   Conclusions: The administration of GTCs with caffeine is associated with statistically significant reductions in BMI, body weight, and WC; however, the clinical significance of these reductions is modest at best. Current data do not suggest that GTCs alone positively alter anthropometric measurements. Am J Clin Nutr 2010; 91: 73-81.

AB Yerba mate (mate) tea, a herbal tea prepared from the leaves of hex paraguariensis, is widely consumed in southern Latin America, and is gaining popularity worldwide. We investigated effects of an aqueous extract of mate on metabolic syndrome features in a metabolic syndrome model Tsumura Suzuki obese diabetic (TSOD) mouse. Oral administration of mate (100 mg/kg) for 7 weeks induced significant decreases in body weight, body mass index, and food intake in TSOD. It significantly decreased the hyperglycemia by reducing fasting blood glucose level, and increasing glucose uptake in glucose tolerance test. It also showed significant improvement in insulin sensitivity by increasing glucose uptake in insulin tolerance test, increasing quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and decreasing homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index. The results also showed significant effects of mate on hyperlipidemia by decreasing blood levels of triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, and total cholesterol. Moreover, mate significantly improved adiponectin (AD) level, and exhibited significant reduction in white adipose tissue weight, and adiposity index in TSOD. It also showed significant ameliorative effects on TSOD histopathology, by reducing adipocytes proliferation, and improving hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, mate administration induced a dose-dependent delay in gastric emptying.
   The current data suggest that mate ameliorates metabolic syndrome by mechanisms involving increase of peripheral insulin sensitivity and cellular glucose uptake, and by modulating the level of circulating lipid metabolites and AD. These results indicate that mate can induce protective and ameliorative effects on insulin resistance, diabesity, and dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: The overall consumption of foods most frequently consumed in a typical Italian breakfast might be associated with a better cardiovascular risk profile in Italian adults.
   Method sand Results: 18,177 subjects (53,2% women), aged >= 35 yrs, randomly selected from the Moli-sani Project population were studied.
   The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) FFQ was used for dietary assessment. To derive breakfast pattern, an "a priori" approach was used: firstly, foods typical of the Italian breakfast were selected: milk, coffee, tea, yogurt, crispbread/rusks, breakfast cereals, brioche, biscuits, honey, sugar and jam. The breakfast score was obtained adding the amounts of all selected foods, expressed in grams/day, previously standardized to mean zero and standard deviation 1.
   Subjects showing a higher breakfast score appeared to be younger, more frequently women or smokers, with higher social status but less likely practicing physical activity. After multivariable analyses, subjects with a higher breakfast food consumption had a lower risk to have high body mass index, abdominal obesity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol (P < 0.0001 for all) and C Reactive Protein (P = 0.022). The associations were unrelated to age, sex, smoking, obesity, physical activity and social status. Subjects with a higher food breakfast score also showed a better physical healthy status score, a lower risk of metabolic syndrome (OR = 0.63; 0.55-0.72 95% CI) and of future CVD (P < 0.0001 for both women and men).
   Conclusion: Consumption of typical Italian breakfast foods positively affects CVD risk profile in an adult Italian population. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Higher serum C-peptide concentrations have shown to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, we used diet information to identify food groups that correlated with fasting serum concentrations of C-peptide and assess the association of this dietary pattern and CRC risk.
   Major food contributors to fasting C-peptide concentrations were identified with stepwise linear regression in a subsample ( = 833) of women from a large cohort. We then summed the consumption frequency of the major food contributors to form a C-peptide dietary pattern for the entire cohort ( = 66,714). Risk for CRC was computed using Cox proportional hazard model with the C-peptide dietary pattern score as the predictor.
   In up to 20 years of follow-up, we ascertained 985 cases of CRC and 758 colon cancer. After adjusting for confounders, the C-peptide dietary pattern, characterized by higher meat, fish, and sweetened beverage intake, but lower coffee, high fat dairy, and whole grains intake, showed direct association with CRC risk (RR comparing extreme quintiles = 1.29, 95 % CI = 1.05-1.58, trend = 0.048). The same comparison was slightly stronger for colon cancer (RR = 1.35, 95 % CI = 1.07-1.70, trend = 0.009). In stratified analysis, there was no association between the C-peptide dietary pattern and colon cancer among lean and active women. However, for overweight or sedentary women, RR for the same comparison was 1.58 (95 % CI = 1.20-2.07, trend = 0.002) ( for interaction = 0.007).
   We derived a dietary pattern that correlated with C-peptide concentrations. This pattern was associated with an increase in colon cancer, especially among women who were overweight or sedentary.

AB Research on the effect of caffeine on energy expenditure (EE), physical activity (PA), and total sleep time (TST) during free-living conditions using objective measures is scarce. We aimed to determine the impact of a moderate dose of caffeine on TST, resting EE (REE), physical activity EE (PAEE), total EE (TEE), and daily time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities in a 4-day period and the acute effects on heart rate (HR) and EE in physically active males. Using a double-blind crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01477294) with two conditions (4 days each with 3-day washout) randomly ordered as caffeine (5 mg/kg of body mass/day) and placebo (maltodextrin) administered twice per day (2.5 mg/kg), 30 nonsmoker males, low-caffeine users (<100 wmg/day), aged 20-39, were followed. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. PA was assessed by accelerometry, while a combined HR and movement sensor estimated EE and HR on the second hour after the first administration dose. REE was assessed by indirect calorimetry, and PAEE was calculated as [TEE - (REE + 0.1TEE)]. TST and daily food records were obtained. Repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA were used. After a 4-day period, adjusting for fat-free mass, PAEE, and REE, TST was reduced (p = 0.022) under caffeine intake, while no differences were found between conditions for REE, PAEE, TEE, and PA patterns. Also, no acute effects on HR and EE were found between conditions. Though a large individual variability was observed, our findings revealed no acute or long-term effects of caffeine on EE and PA but decreased TST during free-living conditions in healthy males.

AB Migration of green tea components from an active packaging material containing green tea extract was performed in water and 3% acetic acid in water. The migration values for acid simulant were much higher than the values obtained in water. The influence of the acidic media in solutions of catechin standards and green tea extract was evaluated by liquid chromatography. Catechin, epicatechin, and caffeine from the green tea extract exhibited major variation in their concentrations values, with increases of 29.90, 20.75, and 15.95%, respectively, in acidic medium. The results suggested that catechins and caffeine form complexes through intermolecular interactions in neutral media and that these interactions are broken in acidic media. The continuous variation method was also performed to confirm the stoichiometry of the complexes between catechins and caffeine. Finally, a computer simulation was applied by Chem Pro 12.0, and the energies involved were calculated to confirm the experimental results obtained.

AB In 2009 Hungarian Food Safety Office (HFSO) performed a countrywide representative dietary survey to obtain food consumption data for quantitative food safety risk assessment utilizable in the field of public health nutrition as well. The consumption of foodstuffs, daily energy-and nutrient intakes, nutritional habits and dietary supplement usage of Hungarian population was assessed. The complex system has included three-day dietary record and a food consumption frequency questionnaire. Some anthropometric parameters were also self-recorded. According to the body mass index, a considerable proportion of both the 31-60 years old males (69%) and females (46%) were overweight or obese. The energy intake of the Hungarian adult population is slightly exceeds the recommendation. The intake of proteins is satisfactory in general. The average intake of total fats is very high (36.1-38.9 energy percent), and the fatty acid composition - mostly the ratio of n-6/n-3 fatty acids - is unfavourable, but the fatty acid pattern regarding saturated-(SFA), mono-(MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acid ratio shows favourable tendency. The proportion of complex carbohydrates within the intake of energy providing macronutrients is far lower than the optimal level, but it is a positive finding that added sugar intake is below the outmost recommendation. The average daily cholesterol intake is high (males: 469 mg, females: 335 mg), whilst the dietary fibre intake is lower than the recommended. The article provides data on alcohol, caffeine and fibre consumption, too.

AB Introduction: Increased fat mass is becoming more prevalent in women and its accumulation in the abdominal region can lead to numerous health risks such as diabetes mellitus. The clay body wrap using compounds such as green clay, green tea and magnesium sulfate, in addition to microcurrent, may reduce abdominal fat mass and minimize or prevent numerous health problems.
   Objective: This study aims at measuring the influence of the clay body wrap with microcurrent and aerobic exercise on abdominal fat.
   Methods: Nineteen female patients, randomized into intervention (n = 10) and control (n = 9) groups, were evaluated using ultrasound for visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat, calipers and abdominal region perimeter for subcutaneous fat and bioimpedance for weight, fat mass percentage and muscular mass. During 10 sessions (5 weeks, twice a week) both groups performed aerobic exercise in a cycloergometer and a clay body wrap with microcurrent was applied to the intervention group.
   Results: When comparing both groups after 5 weeks of protocol, there was a significant decrease in the subcutaneous fat around left anterior superior iliac spine in the intervention group (p = 0.026 for a confidence interval 95%). When comparing initial and final abdominal fat in the intervention group, measured by ultrasound (subcutaneous and visceral fat) and by skinfold (subcutaneous fat), we detected a significant abdominal fat reduction.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the clay body wrap used with microcurrent and aerobic exercise can have a positive effect on central fat reduction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of artichoke leaf extract (ALE) supplementation (250 mg, 2 b.i.d.) on the lipid pattern. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 92 overweight subjects with primary mild hypercholesterolaemia for 8 weeks. Forty-six subjects were randomized to supplementation (age: 54.2 +/- 6.6 years, body mass index (BMI): 25.8 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2), male/female: 20/26) and 46 subjects to placebo (age: 53.8 +/- 9.0 years, BMI: 24.8 +/- 1.6 kg/m(2), male/female: 21/25). Verum supplementation was associated with a significant increase in mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (p < 0.001) and in mean change in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) (p = 0.004). A significantly decreased difference was also found for the mean change in total cholesterol (p = 0.033), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (p < 0.001), total cholesterol/HDL ratio (p < 0.001) and LDL/HDL ratio (p < 0.001), when verum and placebo treatment were compared. These results indicate that ALE could play a relevant role in the management of mild hypercholesterolaemia, favouring in particular the increase in HDL-C, besides decreasing total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Half a dozen of the currently accepted 135 Turnera species are used in traditional medicine, most notably Turnera diffusa Willd. ex Schult. which is one of the most highly appreciated plant aphrodisiacs. Other traditional uses of Turnera L species include the treatment of anaemia, bronchitis, cough, diabetes, fever, fungal disease, gastrointestinal complaints, pain, pulmonary and respiratory diseases, skin disorders, and women's health problems. Additionally, Turnera species are used as abortives, expectorants, and laxatives.
   Phytochemistiy: Flavonoids (22 different compounds), maltol glucoside, phenolics, cyanogenic glycosides (7 different compounds), monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, the polyterpene ficaprenol-11, fatty acids, and caffeine have been found in the genus Turnera.
   Bioactivity: Bioactivities experimentally proven for members of the genus Tumera encompass antianxiety, antiaromatase, antibacterial including antimycobacterial, antidiabetic, antioxidant, adapatogenic, antiobesity, antispasmodic, cytotoxic, gastroprotective, hepatoprotective, and aphrodisiac activities. Most of these activities have so far been investigated only in chemical, cell based, or animal assays. In contrast, the antiobesity activity was also investigated in a study on healthy human subjects and with a herbal preparation containing among other ingredients Tumera diffusa leaves. Moreover, the enhancement of female sexual function was assessed in humans; again the product contained besides Turnera diffusa other potentially bioactive ingredients. However, with only few exceptions, most of the traditional uses and the experimentally verified bioactivities can currently not be related to a particular compound or compound class. A notable exception is the flavonoid apigenin, which was identified animal experiments as the antinociceptive principle of Tumera diffusa.
   Conclusion: In this review, the current knowledge on ethnobotanical uses of members of the genus Turnera, the secondary metabolites reported from Tumera, and experimentally documented bioactivities from Tumera extracts and pure compounds derived from Tumera extracts are compiled. Moreover, some of the most interesting avenues for future research projects are being discussed briefly. These include in particular the aphrodisiac activity of Tumera diffusa and the antibiotic activity potentiating effect of Tumera ulmifolia L. against aminoglycoside resistant bacteria.

AB Objective. Insulin resistance (IR) is regarded as one of the earliest features of many metabolic diseases, and major efforts are aimed at improving insulin function to confront this issue. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, green tea and coffee consumption to IR. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional study of 1542 male self defense officials. IR was defined as the highest quartile of the fasting plasma insulin (>= 50 pmol/L) or the homeostasis model assessment-estimated IR (HOMA-IR >= 1.81). An unconditional logistic model was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between IR and influential factors. Stratified analysis by obesity status (BMI < 25 kg/m(2), non-obese; >= 25 kg/m(2), obese) was performed. Results. IR was significantly positively related to BMI and glucose tolerance, negatively related to alcohol use. Independent of obesity status, significant trends were observed between IR and alcohol use. Drinking 30 mL or more of ethanol per day reduced IR by less than 40%. Strong physical activity was associated with decreased risk of IR based on fasting plasma insulin only in the obese. Coffee consumption was inversely associated with the risk of IR based on HOMA-IR in the non-obese group. Conclusion. Higher coffee consumption may be protective against IR among only the non-obese. Further studies are warranted to examine the effect modification of the obesity status on the coffee-IR association.

AB The effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and caffeine on non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) during cold exposure is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to quantify the effects of co-ingesting EGCG and caffeine on the thermogenic responses of a 3 h cold exposure. A total of eight healthy males were exposed to mild cold, using a liquid-conditioned suit perfused with 15 degrees C water, on two occasions and consumed a placebo or an extract of 1600 mg of EGCG and 600 mg of caffeine (Green tea). Thermic, metabolic and electromyographic measurements were monitored at baseline and during the cold exposure. Results showed that the AUC of shivering intensity over the cold exposure period was reduced by approximately 20% in the Green tea (266 (SEM 6)% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) x min) compared with the Placebo (332 (SEM 69)% MVC x min) (P=0.01) treatments. In contrast, the total AUC for energy expenditure (EE) was approximately 10% higher in the Green tea (23.5 (SEM 1.4) kJ/kg x 180 min) compared with the Placebo (327 (SEM 74) kJ/kg 180 min) (P=0.007) treatments. The decrease in shivering activity combined with an increase in EE, following the ingestion of EGCG and caffeine during the cold exposure, indicates that NST pathways can be significantly stimulated in adult human subjects. The present study provides an experimental approach for human investigations into the potential role of diet and bioactive food ingredients in modulating NST during cold exposure. Stimulating NST pathways in such a manner may also provide important targets in the search of targets for the management of obesity and diabetes.

AB Background
   Preparations of green tea are used as aids in weight loss and weight maintenance. Catechins and caffeine, both contained in green tea, are each believed to have a role in increasing energy metabolism, which may lead to weight loss. A number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the role of green tea in weight loss have been published; however, the efficacy of green tea preparations in weight loss remains unclear.
   Objectives
   To assess the efficacy and safety of green tea preparations for weight loss and weight maintenance in overweight or obese adults.
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases from inception to specified date as well as reference lists of relevant articles: The Cochrane Library (Issue 12, 2011), MEDLINE (December 2011), EMBASE (December 2011), CINAHL (January 2012), AMED (January 2012), Biological Abstracts (January 2012), IBIDS (August 2010), Obesity+ (January 2012), IPA (January 2012) and Web of Science (December 2011). Current Controlled Trials with links to other databases of ongoing trials was also searched.
   Selection criteria
   RCTs of at least 12 weeks' duration comparing green tea preparations to a control in overweight or obese adults.
   Data collection and analysis
   Three authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias and quality, with differences resolved by consensus. Heterogeneity of included studies was assessed visually using forest plots and quantified using the I-2 statistic. We synthesised data using meta-analysis and descriptive analysis as appropriate; subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Adverse effects reported in studies were recorded.
   Main results
   Due to the level of heterogeneity among studies, studies were divided into two groups; those conducted in Japan and those conducted outside Japan. Study length ranged between 12 and 13 weeks. Meta-analysis of six studies conducted outside Japan showed a mean difference (MD) in weight loss of -0.04 kg (95% CI -0.5 to 0.4; P = 0.88; I-2 = 18%; 532 participants). The eight studies conducted in Japan were not similar enough to allow pooling of results and MD in weight loss ranged from -0.2 kg to -3.5 kg (1030 participants) in favour of green tea preparations. Meta-analysis of studies measuring change in body mass index (BMI) conducted outside Japan showed a MD in BMI of -0.2 kg/m(2) (95% CI -0.5 to 0.1; P = 0.21; I-2 = 38%; 222 participants). Differences among the eight studies conducted in Japan did not allow pooling of results and showed a reduction in BMI ranging from no effect to -1.3 kg/m(2) (1030 participants), in favour of green tea preparations over control. Meta-analysis of five studies conducted outside Japan and measuring waist circumference reported a MD of -0.2 cm (95% CI -1.4 to 0.9; P = 0.70; I2 = 58%; 404 participants). Differences among the eight studies conducted in Japan did not allow pooling of results and showed effects on waist circumference ranging from a gain of 1 cm to a loss of 3.3 cm (1030 participants). Meta-analysis for three weight loss studies, conducted outside Japan, with waist-to-hip ratio data (144 participants) yielded no significant change (MD 0; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01). Analysis of two studies conducted to determine if green tea could help to maintain weight after a period of weight loss (184 participants) showed a change in weight loss of 0.6 to -1.6 kg, a change in BMI from 0.2 to -0.5 kg/m(2) and a change in waist circumference from 0.3 to -1.7 cm. In the eight studies that recorded adverse events, four reported adverse events that were mild to moderate, with the exception of two (green tea preparations group) that required hospitalisation (reported as not associated with the intervention). Nine studies reported on compliance/adherence, one study assessed attitude towards eating as part of the health-related quality of life outcome. No studies reported on patient satisfaction, morbidity or cost.
   Authors' conclusions
   Green tea preparations appear to induce a small, statistically non-significant weight loss in overweight or obese adults. Because the amount of weight loss is small, it is not likely to be clinically important. Green tea had no significant effect on the maintenance of weight loss. Of those studies recording information on adverse events, only two identified an adverse event requiring hospitalisation. The remaining adverse events were judged to be mild to moderate.

AB Energy drinks are frequently marketed to individuals interested in athletics and an active lifestyle. From 2001 to 2008, estimates of energy drink use in adolescent to middle-aged populations ranged from 24% to 56%. Most energy drinks feature caffeine and a combination of other components, including taurine, sucrose, guarana, ginseng, niacin, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin. This article examines the evidence for 2 commonly purported uses of energy drinks: athletic performance enhancement and weight loss. Observed ergogenic benefits of energy drinks are likely attributable to caffeine and glucose content. There is conflicting evidence regarding the impact of energy drinks on weight loss, although some data suggest that combining energy drink use with exercise may enhance body fat reduction. As with any pharmacologically active substance, energy drinks are associated with adverse effects. Combining energy drinks with alcohol exacerbates safety concerns and is an increasingly common practice contributing to toxic jock identity among college-aged male athletes. Practitioners should monitor identified populations likely to consume these loosely regulated beverages.

AB Maintaining the level of daily energy expenditure during weight loss and weight maintenance is as important as maintaining satiety while decreasing energy intake. In this context, different catechin- and caffeine-rich teas (CCRTs), such as green, oolong, and white teas, as well as caffeine have been proposed as tools for maintaining or enhancing energy expenditure and for increasing fat oxidation. Tea polyphenols have been proposed to counteract the decrease in metabolic rate that is usually present during weight loss. Their effects may be of particular importance during weight maintenance after weight loss. Although the thermogenic effect of CCRT has the potential to produce significant effects on these metabolic targets as well as on fat absorption and energy intake, possibly via its impact on the gut microbiota and gene expression, a clinically meaningful outcome also depends on compliance by the subjects. Limitations to this approach require further examination, including moderating factors such as genetic predisposition, habitual caffeine intake, and catechin composition and dose. Nevertheless, CCRTs may be useful agents that could help in preventing a positive energy balance and obesity.

AB Beverages are selected based on availability, culture, taste preference, health, safety and social context. Beverages may be important to energy and to the macronutrient and micronutrient quality of overall intake. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of beverages to the dietary energy and estimated macro- and micronutrient intake to the diet of young schoolchildren. We analyzed data from third- and fourth-grade urban Guatemalan school-children aged predominantly 8-10 years old. One-day pictorial registries of all beverages, foods and snacks consumed over a 24-h period were collected from children from private (n = 219) and public (n = 230) schools. Food composition nutrient values were assigned to the items consumed. Eleven main categories of beverages were identified. The contribution of each of the 11 beverage categories to energy, macro- and micronutrients was evaluated. The estimated intake of beverages was 475 300 mL, as reported by the 449 children. As a group, the beverage consumed in the greatest quantity was coffee (126 500 mL), followed by plain water (62 000 mL). Beverages represented a mean energy contribution of 418 +/- 26 kcal (21.5% of total dietary energy). The beverages varied in energy density from 0 (water) to 1.5 kcal mL-1 (thin gruels). Beverages contributed one-third of the dietary carbohydrate. Through the contribution of fortified drinks, beverages were important sources of vitamin A (55%), vitamin C (38%), zinc (21%) and calcium (19%). Milk was an important source for vitamin D (10%). These results show the importance of drinks to nutrition and the balance of concerns of overweight/obesity with micronutrient quality.

AB Background: The effect of green tea catechins (GTCs) with or without caffeine on glycemic control is controversial.
   Objective: We aimed to identify and quantify the effects of GTCs or GTC-caffeine mixtures on glucose metabolism in adults.
   Design: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant trials of GTCs with or without caffeine on markers of glycemic control [fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting blood insulin (FBI), glycated hemoglobin (Hb A(1c)), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)]. Weighted mean differences were calculated for net changes by using fixed-effects models. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed to explore the influence of covariates on net changes in FBG and FBI concentrations.
   Results: Twenty-two eligible randomized controlled trials with 1584 subjects were identified. Pooled analyses showed that FBG (-1.48 mg/dL; 95% CI: -2.57, -0.40 mg/dL) decreased significantly with GTCs with or without caffeine, whereas FBI (0.04 mu U/mL; 95% CI: -0.36, 0.45 mu U/mL), Hb A(1c) (-0.04%; 95% CI: -0.15, 0.08%), and HOMA-IR (-0.05; 95% CI: -0.37, 0.26) did not. Subgroup analyses indicated that the glucose-lowering effect was apparent when the duration of follow-up was over a median of 12 wk. Overall, no significant heterogeneity was detected for FBG, FBI, Hb A(1c), or HOMA-IR.
   Conclusions: The meta-analysis showed that the administration of GTCs with or without caffeine resulted in a significant reduction in FBG. The limited data available on GTCs did not support a positive effect on FBI, Hb A(1c), or HOMA-IR. Thus, more large and well-designed trials are needed in the future.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effects of combination caffeine/ephedrine and leptin A-200 on visceral fat mass and weight loss over 24 weeks.
   Design and Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm trial, 90 obese subjects received one of the three treatments for 24 weeks: 200 mg caffeine/20 mg ephedrine t.i.d. (CE), leptin A-200 (recombinant methionyl human Fc-leptin, 20 mg q.d.) (L), or combination leptin A-200 and caffeine/ephedrine (LCE). Outcomes included change in weight, visceral fat mass by computed tomography, lean mass and fat mass by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.
   Results: Groups treated with CE and LCE lost significant amounts of weight (-5.9 +/- 1.2% and -6.5 +/- 1.1%, P < 0.05) and whole body fat mass (-9.6 +/- 2.4% and -12.4 +/- 2.3%, P < 0.05) compared to leptin only group. Only treatment with LCE significantly reduced visceral fat mass (-11.0 +/- 3.3%, P < 0.05). There were no differences in lean mass between treatment groups.
   Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that CE is a modestly effective weight loss agent and produces significant reductions in fat mass. Leptin A-200 was not effective in producing weight loss and did not have any significant additive or synergistic actions when combined with CE.

AB The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of green tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on changes in body composition, energy and substrate metabolism, cardiometabolic risk factors and liver function enzymes after an energy-restricted diet intervention in obese women. In the present randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, eighty-three obese (30 kg/m(2) > BMI < 40 kg/m(2)) premenopausal women consumed 300 mg/d of EGCG or placebo (lactose). We measured body weight and adiposity (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), energy expenditure and fat oxidation rates (indirect calorimetry), blood lipid levels (TAG, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol), insulin resistance, C-reactive protein and liver function markers (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, g-glutamyltransferase, urea, bilirubin and 2-keto[1-C-13] isocaproate oxidation) before and after the intervention in the EGCG and control groups. We did not find any significant difference in the changes in body weight (-0.3 kg, 95% CI -5.0, 4.3), fat mass (-0.7 kg, 95% CI -3.5, 2.1), energy (0.3 kJ/kg per d, 95% CI -3.1, 2.7) and fat (-0.1 g/min, 95% CI -0.03, 0.01) metabolism, homeostasis assessment model for insulin resistance (0.2, 95% CI -0.2, 0.7), total cholesterol (-0.21 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.55, 0.13), LDL-cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.50, 0.20), TAG (-0.14 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.56, 0.29) and liver function markers between the EGCG and control groups. In conclusion, the present results suggest that dietary supplementation with 300 mg/d of EGCG for 12 weeks did not enhance energy-restricted diet-induced adiposity reductions, and did not improve weight-loss-induced changes in cardiometabolic risk factors in obese Caucasian women. The intake of 300 mg/d of EGCG for 12 weeks did not cause any adverse effect on liver function biomarkers.

   PREVENTION; LIFETIME RISK; DIET; OBESITY; COFFEE
AB Background: Consumption of sugar-sweetened soda has been associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. The relation with cerebrovascular disease has not yet been closely examined.
   Objective: Our objective was to examine patterns of soda consumption and substitution of alternative beverages for soda in relation to stroke risk.
   Design: The Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 84,085 women followed for 28 y (1980-2008), and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, a prospective cohort study of 43,371 men followed for 22 y (1986-2008), provided data on soda consumption and incident stroke.
   Results: We documented 1416 strokes in men during 841,770 person-years of follow-up and 2938 strokes in women during 2,188,230 person-years of follow-up. The pooled RR of total stroke for >= 1 serving of sugar-sweetened soda/d, compared with none, was 1.16 (95% Cl: 1.00, 1.34). The pooled RR of total stroke for >= 1 serving of low-calorie soda/d, compared with none, was 1.16(95% CI: 1.05, 1.28), Compared with 1 serving of sugar-sweetened soda/d, 1 serving of decaffeinated coffee/d was associated with a 10% (95% Cl: 1%, 19%) lower risk of stroke and 1 serving of caffeinated coffee/d with a 9% (95% Cl: 0%, 17%) lower risk. Similar estimated reductions in risk were seen for substitution of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee for low-calorie soda.
   Conclusions: Greater consumption of sugar-sweetened and low-calorie sodas was associated with a significantly higher risk of stroke. This risk may be reduced by substituting alternative beverages for soda. Am J Clin Nutr 2012;95:1190-9.

AB Obesity plays a critical role in dyslipidemia and related disorders. Mulberry water extracts (MWEs) contain polyphenols, including gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, rutin, and anthocyanins. In this study, using 6-week-old male hamsters, we investigated the anti-obese effect of MWEs. After 12 weeks of treatment, MWEs lowered high-fat diet (HED)-induced body weight and visceral fat, accompanied with hypolipidemic effects by reducing serum triacylglycerol, cholesterol, free fatty acid, and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (n = 8 for each group). MWEs decreased hepatic lipids, thus protected livers from impairment. The hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 were elevated, while fatty acid synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase were reduced by MWEs, indicating that MWEs regulated lipogenesis and lipolysis, which exerted the anti-obese and hypolipidemic effects. Noticeably, MWEs showed both efficacy and safety in vivo. In concluson, MWEs can be used to reduce body weight, serum, and liver lipids.

AB In this study, we investigated preventive effects of black tea on obesity and hyperglycemia in C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet for 14 weeks. During the feeding period, mice were given the following black teas: BT1 containing 3,000 mg/L total catechins and 864 mg/L caffeine; and BT2 containing 1,437 mg/L total catechins and 594 mg/L caffeine. Both BT1 and BT2 suppressed high-fat diet-caused body weight gain, deposition of white adipose tissue, and increases in plasma lipids and glucose. Moreover, both BT1 and BT2 counteracted the high-fat diet-caused decrease in the expression of insulin receptor (IR)-beta and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), markers for insulin resistance. Of these effects, BT2 were stronger than that of BT1. In conclusion, black tea prevents hyperglycemia and insulin resistance through maintenance of IR-beta and GLUT4 expression in high-fat diet-fed mice, with an appropriate concentration of tea producing maximal effectiveness.

AB Background: Numerous natural products are marketed and sold claiming to decrease body weight and fat, but few undergo finished product-specific research demonstrating their safety and efficacy.
   Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of a multi-ingredient supplement containing primarily raspberry ketone, caffeine, capsaicin, garlic, ginger and Citrus aurantium (Prograde Metabolism (TM) [METABO]) as an adjunct to an eight-week weight loss program.
   Methods: Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design, 70 obese but otherwise healthy subjects were randomly assigned to METABO or a placebo and underwent 8 weeks of daily supplementation, a calorie restricted diet, and exercise training. Subjects were tested for changes in body composition, serum adipocytokines (adiponectin, resistin, leptin, TNF-alpha, IL-6) and markers of health including heart rate and blood pressure.
   Results: Of the 45 subjects who completed the study, significant differences were observed in: body weight (METABO -2.0% vs. placebo -0.5%, P < 0.01), fat mass (METABO -7.8 vs. placebo -2.8%, P < 0.001), lean mass (METABO +3.4% vs. placebo +0.8%, P < 0.03), waist girth (METABO -2.0% vs. placebo -0.2%, P < 0.0007), hip girth (METABO -1.7% vs. placebo -0.4%, P < 0.003), and energy levels per anchored visual analogue scale (VAS) (METABO +29.3% vs. placebo +5.1%, P < 0.04). During the first 4 weeks, effects/trends for maintaining elevated serum leptin (P < 0.03) and decreased serum resistin (P < 0.08) in the METABO group vs. placebo were also observed. No changes in systemic hemodynamics, clinical blood chemistries, adverse events, or dietary intake were noted between groups.
   Conclusions: METABO administration is a safe and effective adjunct to an eight-week diet and exercise weight loss program by augmenting improvements in body composition, waist and hip girth. Adherence to the eight-week weight loss program also led to beneficial changes in body fat in placebo. Ongoing studies to confirm these results and clarify the mechanisms (i.e., biochemical and neuroendocrine mediators) by which METABO exerts the observed salutary effects are being conducted.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of yerba mate extract and its principal bioactive compounds on adipogenesis. The anti-adipogenic effects of yerba mate, chlorogenic acid, quercetin and rutin were evaluated in 3T3-L1 cells using a PCR array. The results obtained in vitro were validated in vivo in a high-fat diet-induced model of obesity. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that yerba mate extract down-regulated the expression of genes that regulate adipogenesis, such as Creb-1 and C/EBP alpha, and the extract up-regulated the expression of genes related to the inhibition of adipogenesis, including Dlk1, Gata2, Gata3, Klf2, Lrp5, Ppar gamma 2, Sfrp1, Tcf7l2, Wnt10b, and Wnt3a. In summary, it was demonstrated that yerba mate and its bioactive compounds regulate the expression of genes related to in vitro adipogenesis. Furthermore, yerba mate might regulate adipogenesis through the Wnt pathway. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Coffee polyphenols suppress diet-induced body fat accumulation by downregulating SREBP-1c and related molecules in C57BL/6J mice. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 300: E122-E133, 2011. First published October 13, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00441.2010.-The prevalence of obesity is increasing globally, and obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We investigated the effects of coffee polyphenols (CPP), which are abundant in coffee and consumed worldwide, on diet-induced body fat accumulation. C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control diet, a high-fat diet, or a high-fat diet supplemented with 0.5 to 1.0% CPP for 2-15 wk. Supplementation with CPP significantly reduced body weight gain, abdominal and liver fat accumulation, and infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissues. Energy expenditure evaluated by indirect calorimetry was significantly increased in CPP-fed mice. The mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 and -2, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 in the liver were significantly lower in CPP-fed mice than in high-fat control mice. Similarly, CPP suppressed the expression of these molecules in Hepa 1-6 cells, concomitant with an increase in microRNA-122. Structure-activity relationship studies of nine quinic acid derivatives isolated from CPP in Hepa 1-6 cells suggested that mono-or di-caffeoyl quinic acids (CQA) are active substances in the beneficial effects of CPP. Furthermore, CPP and 5-CQA decreased the nuclear active form of SREBP-1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, and cellular malonyl-CoA levels. These findings indicate that CPP enhances energy metabolism and reduces lipogenesis by downregulating SREBP-1c and related molecules, which leads to the suppression of body fat accumulation.

AB Consumption of cola beverages is very high worldwide. The health effects of cola intake are not clear, although epidemiological studies point toward associations with obesity, kidney diseases and osteoporosis. Experimental studies are surprisingly rare. In this study, we substituted drinking water of adult male Wistar rats with three different cola beverages for 3 months. Behavioural phenotyping, measurement of sex steroids in plasma and oxidative stress in testes were performed at the end of the study. A light-dark box showed increased locomotor activity and anxiety in all groups with cola intake. A subtle anti-depressive effect was seen in the forced swim test. Chronic cola intake increased both oestradiol and testosterone levels suggesting an additional mechanism of action beyond the known effects of caffeine on adenosine receptors.

AB Objective: Stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1) is a key enzyme in fatty acid and energy metabolism. Increased hepatic SCD1 activity is associated with obesity and obesity-related diseases. We examined the relations of two plasma SCD activity indices (16:1n-7/16:0, 18:1n-9/18:0) with body composition, and the association of lifestyle and dietary variables with the plasma SCD indices.
   Design and Methods: This population-based, cross-sectional study of 2021 elderly (71-74 y) men and women from the Hordaland Health Study in Western Norway was conducted using a validated food frequency questionnaire, body composition measurements by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and determination of the plasma fatty acid profile.
   Results: In multivariate regression analyses, plasma SCD indices were positively associated with BMI and body fat (P<0.001 for both). From the 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles of plasma SCD-16 and SCD-18 indices, fat mass differed by about 8 kg and 5 kg, respectively. Intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids were negatively associated with SCD-16 (partial r = -0.30) and SCD-18 (partial r = -0.24) (P<0.001 for both). Alcohol intake was positively associated with SCD-16 (partial r = 0.26) and SCD-18 (partial r = 0.16) (P<0.001 for both), whereas coffee consumption and physical activity were inversely associated with SCD-16 (P = 0.026 and P = 0.006, respectively) and SCD-18 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.022, respectively).
   Conclusions: In this elderly population, plasma markers of SCD1 activity are associated with increased adiposity. Furthermore, modifiable dietary habits and lifestyle are associated with plasma SCD indices. These results suggest that SCD1 activity may be a promising target for weight control.

AB One of the most important strategy in the treatment of obesity includes the development of nutrient digestion and absorption inhibitors. Inhibition of digestive enzymes is one of the most widely studied mechanisms used to determine the potential efficacy of natural products as hypolipidemic and hypoglycaemic agents. In vitro studies here reported were performed to evaluate the inhibitory activity of five species (as hydroalcoholic extracts) of edible plants from Calabria region (Italy) on amylase and lipase by monitoring the hydrolysis of p-NPC and the hydrolysis of glycoside bonds in digestible carbohydrate foods. The formulation obtained from Clematis vitalba L. exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on pancreatic lipase (IC50 = 0.99 mg/ml) and on alpha-amylase (IC50 = 31.52 mu g/ml). In order to explore metabolome production HPTLC analysis of the extracts was performed, revealing the predominance of (+/-)-catechin, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid in C. vitalba formulation at concentration of 23.18 +/- 3.14, 13.63 +/- 0.65 and 18.88 +/- 0.76 mg/g, respectively. GC/MS analysis was used to identify fatty acids and terpene composition.

AB This study evaluated the antioxidant activity and anti-diabetic effect of mulberry (Morus alba L. wielkolistna zolwinska) leaf extracts in diabetic rats fed a high-fat diet. After initial 4-week high-fat diet, streptozotocin was injected in Wistar rats to induce non-obese type 2 diabetes. After confirmation of diabetes, animals were treated with mulberry dried leaves, leaf-derived ethanol or acetone extracts added to high-fat diet for 4 weeks. Mulberry ethanol extract with higher level of phenolics - chlorogenic acid and flavonol glucosides was more effective than acetone extract or dry leaves in the lowering of blood glucose, increasing insulin level and markers of antioxidant activity. The results confirm key mechanisms related to the effect of mulberry and its bioactive components on modulation of glucose metabolism through correcting hyperglycaemia, increasing insulin secretion, and improving antioxidant status in STZ-induced non-obese diabetic rat model. Antidiabetic effects exerted by mulberry leaves might depend on the extraction process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) were used to identify prenatal/pregnancy, infant, and early childhood predictors of severe kindergarten obesity (body mass index (BMI) >= 99th percentile) in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort, a nationally representative longitudinal study that followed children from birth through kindergarten.
   RESULTS: For the 6800 children, the severe kindergarten obesity prevalence was 5.7%, with higher adjusted odds for crossing the 85th percentile of BMI at 2 years old (odds ratio (OR), 8.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.1-15.7), preschool age (OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 4.9-12.8) and 9 months old (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.6); maternal severe obesity (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9-5.8) and gestational diabetes (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.5); drinking tea or coffee between meals/before bedtime at 2 years old (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.5); Latino (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.7) and multiracial (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8) race/ethnicity; and drinking sugary beverages at kindergarten age at least weekly (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.7). Ever-attending center-based daycare (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9), eating fruit at least weekly at kindergarten age (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7), and maternal history of a prior newborn birth weight >= 4000 g (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.02-0.6) were associated with reduced odds of severe obesity. RPA identified low severe obesity prevalence (1.9%) for non-85th BMI-percentile preschool crossers and high severe obesity (56-80%) for predictor clusters which included crossing the 85th BMI percentile at earlier ages, low parental education, specific maternal age cutoffs, preschooler bedtime rules, and outside walking/play frequency for 9-month-olds.
   CONCLUSIONS: Certain parental, prenatal/pregnancy, infant, and early childhood factors, both alone and in combination, are potent predictors of severe obesity in kindergarteners. International Journal of Obesity (2013) 37, 31-39; doi: 10.1038/ijo.2012.168; published online 13 November 2012

AB To investigate the effect of Yerba Mate (YM) aqueous extract intake on the NF-kB pathway and AKT expression in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue of rats submitted to a high-fat diet (HFD). Male Wistar rats were fed a control (CON) (n = 24) or a HFD (n = 24) for 12 weeks. Afterwards, rats received YM daily (1 g/kg body weight) for 4 weeks. Intake of YM aqueous extract reduced body weight gain (p<0.05) and total blood cholesterol (p<0.05) in the HFD group in comparison to the non-treated HFD group. HFD group demonstrated an increased glycemic response at 5 and 10 min after insulin injection. YM decreased the ratio between phosphorylated and total kinase inhibitor of kappa B (IKK), increased the ratio of phosphorylated to total form of protein kinase B (AKT) and reduced NF-kappa B phosphorylation in the liver of the HFD group. Our data suggest a beneficial role of YM in improving metabolic dysfunctions induced by HFD.

AB Recent reports on cocoa are appealing in that a food commonly consumed for pure pleasure might also bring tangible benefits for human health. Cocoa consumption is correlated with reduced health risks of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cancer, and the health-promoting effects of cocoa are mediated by cocoa-driven phytochemicals. Cocoa is rich in procyanidins, theobromine, (-)-epicatechin, catechins, and caffeine. Among the phytochemicals present in consumed cocoa, theobromine is most available in human plasma, followed by caffeine, (-)-epicatechin, catechin, and procyanidins. It has been reported that cocoa phytochemicals specifically modulate or interact with specific molecular targets linked to the pathogenesis of chronic human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, diabetes, and skin aging. This review summarizes comprehensive recent findings on the beneficial actions of cocoa-driven phytochemicals in molecular mechanisms of human health.

AB The effects of a hot water extract and fractional extracts from rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei reade) leaves (BBL) on lipid metabolism were studied in obese Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. Feeding the hot water extract and fractional extracts from BBL alleviated hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the rats. Additionally, feeding with the flavonol glycoside (FG) and proanthocyanidin (PA) fractions lowered serum cholesterol levels in the obese rats. The results from measurements of the hepatic enzyme activity indicate that the hypolipidemic effects of the hot water extract and the PA fraction might be attributable to enhanced lipolysis in the liver. The reduced serum levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory cytokine, by the chlorogenic acid + rutin fraction and FG fraction might be associated with alleviating the metabolic abnormalities in obese rats. These results indicate that the BBL extracts, and especially FG and PA, exerted hypolipidemic effects on obese OLETF rats and suggest that an infusion of BBL can be useful as a dietary hypolipidemic component.

AB Ilex paraguariensis dried and minced leaves are made into a brewed tea, prepared in a sui generis manner by large populations in South America, having evolved from a tea drunk by the Guarani ethnic group to a beverage that has a social and almost ritualistic role in some South American modern societies. It is used both as a source of caffeine, in lieu or in parallel with tea and coffee, but also as a therapeutic agent for its alleged pharmacological properties. Although with some exceptions, research on biomedical properties of this herb has had a late start and strongly lags behind the impressive amount of literature on green tea and coffee. However, in the past 15 years, there was a several-fold increase in the literature studying Ilex paraguariensis properties showing effects such as antioxidant properties in chemical models and ex vivo lipoprotein studies, vaso-dilating and lipid reduction properties, antimutagenic effects, controversial association with oropharyngeal cancer, anti-glycation effects and weight reduction properties. Lately, promising results from human intervention studies have surfaced and the literature offers several developments on this area. The aim of this review is to provide a concise summary of the research published in the past three years, with an emphasis on translational studies, inflammation and lipid metabolism. Ilex paraguariensis reduces LDL-cholesterol levels in humans with Ilex paraguariensis dyslipoproteinemia and the effect is synergic with that of statins. Plasma antioxidant capacity as well as expression of antioxidant enzymes is positively modulated by intervention with Ilex paraguariensis in human cohorts. A review on the evidence implicating Ilex paraguariensis heavy consumption with some neoplasias show data that are inconclusive but indicate that contamination with alkylating agents during the drying process of the leaves should be avoided. On the other hand, several new studies confirm the antimutagenic effects of Ilex paraguariensis in different models, from DNA double breaks in cell culture models to mice studies. Novel interesting work has emerged showing significant effect on weight reduction both in mice and in rat models. Some mechanisms involved are inhibition of pancreatic lipase, activation of AMPK and uncoupling of electron transport. Intervention studies in animals have provided strong evidence of anti-inflammatory effects of Ilex paraguariensis, notably protecting cigarette-induced lung inflammation acting on macrophage migration and inactivating matrix-metalloproteinase. Research on the effects of Ilex paraguariensis in health and disease has confirmed its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic and lipid-lowering activities. Although we are still waiting for the double-blind, randomized prospective clinical trial, the evidence seems to provide support for beneficial effects of mate drinking on chronic diseases with inflammatory component and lipid metabolism disorders.

AB Adiponectin is the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes, being a key component in the interrelationship between adiposity, insulin resistance and inflammation. Central obesity accompanied by insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of metabolic syndrome (MS) and future macrovascular complications. Moreover, the remarkable correlation between coronary artery disease (CAD) and alterations in glucose metabolism has raised the likelihood that atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may share a common biological background. We summarize here the current knowledge about the influence of adiponectin on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, discussing its forthcoming prospects and potential role as a therapeutic target for MS, T2DM, and cardiovascular disease. Adiponectin is present in the circulation as a dimer, trimer or protein complex of high molecular weight hexamers, >400 kDa. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are its major receptors in vivo mediating the metabolic actions. Adiponectin stimulates phosphorylation and AMP (adenosin mono phosphate) kinase activation, exerting direct effects on vascular endothelium, diminishing the inflammatory response to mechanical injury and enhancing endothelium protection in cases of apolipoprotein E deficiency. Hypoadiponectinemia is consistently associated with obesity, MS, atherosclerosis, CAD, T2DM. Lifestyle correction helps to favorably modify plasma adiponectin levels. Low adiponectinemia in obese patients is raised via continued weight loss programs in both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals and is also accompanied by reductions in pro-inflammatory factors. Diet modifications, like intake of fish, omega-3 supplementation, adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and coffee consumption also increase adiponectin levels. Antidiabetic and cardiovascular pharmacological agents, like glitazones, glimepiride, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are also able to improve adiponectin concentration. Fibric acid derivatives, like bezafibrate and fenofibrate, have been reported to enhance adiponectin levels as well. T-cadherin, a membrane-associated adiponectin-binding protein lacking intracellular domain seems to be a main mediator of the antiatherogenic adiponectin actions. The finding of novel pharmacologic agents proficient to improve adiponectin plasma levels should be target of exhaustive research. Interesting future approaches could be the development of adiponectin-targeted drugs chemically designed to induce the activaton of its receptors and/or postreceptor signaling pathways, or the development of specific adiponectin agonists.

AB Objective: The present study describes the consumption patterns of sweetened food and drink products in a Catholic Middle Eastern Canadian community and examines its associations with physical activity, sedentary behaviours and BMI. Design: A two-stage cross-sectional design was used. In Stage 1 (n 42), 24 h recalls enabled the identification of sweetened products. In Stage 2 (n 192), an FFQ was administered to measure the daily consumption of these products and to collect sociodemographic and behavioural data. Sweetened products were defined as processed culinary ingredients and ultra-processed products for which total sugar content exceeded 20 % of total energy. Setting: Three Catholic Middle Eastern churches located in Montreal, Canada. Subjects: Normoglycaemic men and women (18-60 years old). Results: Twenty-six sweetened products represented an average consumption of 75.4 g total sugars/d or 15.1 % of daily energy intake (n 190, 56 % women). Soft drinks, juices, sweetened coffee, chocolate, cookies, cakes and muffins were the main sources of consumption and mostly consumed between meals. Age (exp (beta) = 0.99; P < 0.01), physical activity (exp (beta) = 1.08; P < 0.01) and recreational computer use (exp (beta) = 1.17; P < 0.01) were independently associated with sweetened product consumption. The association between sweetened product consumption and physical activity was U-shaped. BMI was not significantly associated with sweetened product consumption but all participants regardless of BMI were above the WHO recommendation for free sugars. Conclusions: Being physically active and spending less time using a computer may favour a reduced consumption of sweetened products. Very active individuals may, however, overconsume such products.

AB Background Dietary patterns are critical in the prevention of chronic disease. The relationship between specific dietary patterns and obesity has not been evaluated in a Korean adult population.
   Objective This study examined whether specific dietary patterns are associated with obesity using survey data of the largest, nationally representative, general Korean population.
   Design The cross-sectional study was comprised of 10,089 Korean adults (19 years or older) who participated in the second and third Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted in 2001 and 2005, respectively. Dietary data were assessed by 24-hour recall method. Obesity was defined as body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) >= 25 which is the cutoff point for adults in the Asian and Pacific regions.
   Results Four dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis (white rice and kimchi pattern; high-fat, sweets, and coffee pattern; meat and alcohol pattern; and grains, vegetables, and fish pattern). Each dietary pattern explained 8.6%, 6.7%, 5.7%, and 5.7% of the variation in food intake, respectively. The white rice and kimchi pattern (P for trend=0.0039) and the high-fat, sweets, and coffee pattern (P for trend=0.0054) were positively associated with obesity after adjustments for age, sex, energy intake, alcohol intake, smoking status, physical activity, and chronic diseases. No significant association was found among the meat and alcohol pattern; the grains, vegetables, and fish pattern; and obesity.
   Conclusions Specific dietary patterns, which include the white rice and kimchi and high-fat, sweets, and coffee patterns, may be independently associated with obesity in Korean adults. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2012;112:246-253.

AB Anti-adipogenic and anti-obesity effects of a green coffee been extract (GCE) from unroasted Coffea canephora Robusta beans were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Insulin-induced adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was inhibited by 25.6 and 87.9% following treatment with 100 and 500 mu g/mL GCE, respectively. Expression of adipogenesis-specific genes was down-regulated. Body weight gains of C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner using GCE (0.3 or 1% in the diet), exhibiting a marked lower gain in 1% GCE-fed mice than in normal diet-fed animals. Decreases in body fat weights and the size of adipocytes were confirmed. GCE supplementation reduced concentrations of blood lipids and leptin, and attenuated hepatic steatosis. GCE inhibits adipogenesis by modulating cell signaling and improves dietary obesity by reducing lipid accumulation and the size of adipocytes.

AB BACKGROUND: Inhibition of digestive enzymes is one of the most widely studied mechanisms used to determine the potential efficacy of natural products as anti-obesity agents. In vitro studies reported here were performed to evaluate the inhibitory activity of formulations of edible plants from Italy on amylase and lipase by monitoring the hydrolysis of nitrophenyl caprilate and the hydrolysis of glycoside bonds in digestible carbohydrate foods.
   RESULTS: The formulation obtained from Capparis sicula exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on pancreatic lipase (IC50 = 0.53 mg mL(-1)) while the Borago officinalis formulation exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on alpha-amylase (IC50 = 31.61 mu g mL(-1)). In order to characterise the extracts, high-performance thin-layer chromatography analysis of the formulations was performed, revealing the predominance of (+/-)-catechin in Mentha aquatica formulation, rutin in C. sicula, and caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid in Echium vulgare.
   CONCLUSION: The results obtained indicated that the extracts of C. sicula and B. officinalis could be good candidates for further studies to isolate pancreatic lipase and alpha-amylase inhibitors, respectively. (C) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The anti-hypertensive effect of Eucommia leaves has been confirmed clinically,(1a,b) and the study of their anti-obesity properties has advanced. 2 However, the compounds involved in their anti-obesity effect have not been fully elucidated. In this Letter, we examined the anti-obesity effect of Eucommia green leaf extract (EGLE) divided into five fractions with high porous polystyrene gel and of the compounds isolated, geniposidic acid, asperuloside and chlorogenic acid, respectively. A metabolic syndrome-like clinical model in mice was generated by feeding a 40% high-fat diet to examine the anti-obesity effects of chronic administration of test substance. After 4 weeks, body weight, white adipose tissue weight, plasma triglyceride levels and total cholesterol levels in the model mice were significantly inhibited by the 30% MeOH fraction (containing much higher levels of asperuloside than the other fractions), and these effects were similar to those of EGLE. Chronic administration of isolated asperuloside in Eucommia leaves suppressed increases in model mouse body weight, white adipose tissue weight, plasma triglyceride levels and free fatty acids levels. These results suggest that asperuloside in Eucommia leaves has important anti-obesity effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims/Introduction: Few studies, especially in Asia, have examined the relevance between metabolic syndrome (MetS), habitual indulgence and dietary behaviors in health-care professionals. The present study evaluates metabolic syndrome rate and its association with habitual indulgence (coffee, tea, alcohol and cigarette smoking) and diet behavior in health-care professionals.
   Materials and Methods: Information was collected from 514 health-care professionals (147 men, 367 women) who underwent routine physical examinations at a medical center in central Taiwan.
   Results: Mean age was 48 +/- 5 years for men and 45 +/- 4 years for women. Mean body mass index was 25.2 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2) for men and 22.5 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2) for women. The age-adjusted MetS rate among subjects was 24.8-11.7% in men and 7.8-5.4% in women, using two different definitions, respectively. The MetS rate among those who occasionally or frequently consumed tea was higher than among those who never consumed tea (P < 0.05). Although the proportion of subjects who had MetS differed among those with differing alcohol drinking habits (never, quit and current; P < 0.05), a posteriori comparisons showed no significant differences between the two groups. Compared with those who had never smoked, the rate was higher in former smokers and current smokers (P < 0.001). No significant association with coffee consumption was found. People with MetS often consumed sweetened beverages (P < 0.05), rarely read nutrition labels and seldom consumed dairy products.
   Conclusions: Health-care professionals who regularly consume tea, smoke, frequently have sweetened drinks, rarely read nutrition labels or rarely consume dairy products are at higher risk of suffering from MetS. (J Diabetes Invest, doi:10.1111/j.2040-1124.2010.00055.x, 2010)

AB Objective: Middle-aged and elderly men with the Lewis blood group phenotype Le(a-b-), have a two-fold higher prevalence of obesity than others. We investigated if the association could be ascribed to differences in lifestyle, or if obesity determinants had a different impact in this group.
   Method: This was a cross-sectional study of 3,290 men aged 53-74 years with a mean of 63 years drawn from the Copenhagen Male Study. The main outcome measure was prevalence of obesity [body mass index (BMI) >= 30 (kg/m(2))].
   Results: Among men with the Le(a-b-) phenotype (n = 315), the prevalence of obesity was 15.6%; it was 8.1% among men with other phenotypes (n = 2,975, p<0.001). Obesity-related life style habits did not differ between Le(a-b-) and other men. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the role of obesity covariates was conspicuously different between men with the Le(a-b-) phenotype and men with other Lewis phenotypes. However, among Le(a-b-) men, a much stronger inverse association was found between high coffee consumption (>7 cups/day vs. less) and obesity, and between lacking fat avoidance and obesity; the odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] for high coffee consumption was 0.2(0.1-0.7) and for avoidance of fatty foods 2.0(1.04-3.7). The association of obesity with leisure time physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, use of sugar in hot beverages, and tea consumption, did not differ between Le(a-b-) men and others.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggests a gene-environment interaction between lifestyle and obesity. Because some ethnic groups have up to 40% with the Le(a-b-) phenotype, the above observations may be of significant public health interest.

AB The incidence and severity of hypertension are affected by nutritional status and intake of many nutrients. Excessive energy intake and obesity arc major causes of hypertension. Obesity is associated with increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, possibly other mineralcorticoid activity, insulin resistance, salt-sensitive hypertension and excess salt intake, and reduced kidney function. High sodium chloride intake strongly predisposes to hypertension. Increased alcohol consumption may acutely elevate blood pressure. High intakes of potassium, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and protein, along with exercise and possibly vitamin D, may reduce blood pressure. Less-conclusive studies suggest that amino acids, tea, green coffee bean extract, dark chocolate, and foods high in nitrates may reduce blood pressure. Short-term studies indicate that specialized diets may prevent or ameliorate mild hypertension; most notable are the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and the DASH low-sodium diet. Long-term compliance to these diets remains a major concern.

AB Water-soluble black Chinese (Pu-Erh) tea extract (BTE), which contains high gallic acid content, has been demonstrated to elicit antiobese effects in animals. Because gallic acid is related with the reduction of visceral fat and cholesterol contents and improvement of obesity in animals, we investigated the effects of BTE intake on 36 preobese Japanese adults (body mass index [BMI], >25-<30 kg/m(2)) in a 12-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled group comparison study using powdered barley tea with or without (placebo) BTE. A follow-up 4-week period after BTE intake termination was monitored to observe the withdrawal effect. All subjects ingested barley tea with or without BTE (333 mg) before each of the 3 daily meals. In the BTE-treated group, the mean pretreament values of body weight and BMI significantly decreased after intake and after BTE withdrawal. However, the corresponding values scored significant differences only from 8 weeks after intake (vs the placebo-treated group). The mean values of the waist circumference indicated a similar tendency. Furthermore, coronal navel section (same anatomical position) images of computed tomography of all BTE- and non BTE-treated subjects revealed that the visceral fat areas (cm(2)) were significantly (P < .05) less in the former 12 weeks after BTE ingestion. Measured biochemical parameters did not indicate significant differences, and BTE-treated subjects did not complain of any adverse effects (abdominal distension, etc). Ingestion of BTE exhibited significant effects in reducing the mean waist circumference, BMI, and visceral fat values and might be useful for weight control and prevention of obesity development (or metabolic syndrome) in humans.

AB This paper describes composition of dried plums and their products (prune juice and dried plum powder) with special attention to possibly bioactive compounds. Dried plums contain significant amounts of sorbitol, quinic acid, chlorogenic acids, vitamin K1, boron, copper, and potassium. Synergistic action of these and other compounds, which are also present in dried plums in less conspicuous amounts, may have beneficial health effects when dried plums are regularly consumed. Snacking on dried plums may increase satiety and reduce the subsequent intake of food, helping to control obesity, diabetes, and related cardiovascular diseases. Despite their sweet taste, dried plums do not cause large postprandial rise in blood glucose and insulin. Direct effects in the gastrointestinal tract include prevention of constipation and possibly colon cancer. The characteristic phenolic compounds and their metabolites may also act as antibacterial agents in both gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. The indirect salutary effects on bone turnover are supported by numerous laboratory studies with animals and cell cultures. Further investigation of phenolic compounds in dried plums, particularly of high molecular weight polymers, their metabolism and biological actions, alone and in synergy with other dried plum constituents, is necessary to elucidate the observed health effects and to indicate other benefits.

AB Water is essential for life and plain water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages is one approach for decreasing energy intake. Due to limited data on characteristics associated with water intake among Korean adolescents, this study examined associations of demographic and behavioral characteristics with plain water intake by using nationally representative sample of South Korean adolescents. The data (2007-2010 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) for 1,288 high school-aged adolescents (15-18 years) were used. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) for factors associated with low water intake (<4 cups/day) and very low water intake (<2.5 cups/day). Nationwide, 38.4% and 19.0% of adolescents reported drinking water <4.0 cups/day and <2.5 cups/day, respectively. The mean plain water intake was 5.7 cups/day for males and 4.1 cups/day for females. Females had significantly higher odds for drinking water <2.5 cups/day (OR = 2.2) than males, whereas adolescents with low milk consumption had significantly lower odds for drinking water <2.5 cups/day (OR = 0.7). Factors significantly associated with a greater odds for drinking water <4 cups/daywere being female (OR = 2.8) and not meeting physical activity recommendations 20 min/day on <3 days/week) (OR = 1.6). Being underweight, overweight, and obese were significantly associated with reduced odds for drinking water <4 cups/day (OR = 0.7, 0.4 and 0.5, respectively). However, intake of soda, coffee drinks, fruits, vegetables, and sodium and eating out were not significantly associated with low or very low water intake. These findings may be used to target intervention efforts to increase plain water intake as part of a healty lifestyle.

AB Background: The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of energy drink consumption and examine the associations of socio-demographic factors and health behaviour with energy drink consumption among young adults in Denmark. Methods: The study is based on a public health survey from 2010 (n= 3923). Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to analyse the association between weekly consumption of energy drink and the potential explanatory factors of interest. Results: In total, 15.8 % of the young adults drink energy drinks on a weekly basis. Men have higher odds of weekly energy drink consumption than women. The study also shows that young age, being employed and having a low educational level are associated with weekly energy drink consumption. According to health behaviour, daily smoking, high amounts of alcohol consumption, alcoholic binge drinking and being overweight are associated with weekly energy drink consumption. Conclusion: Compared with other European countries the prevalence of energy drink consumption is relatively low in Denmark. In Denmark energy drink consumption is typically a male phenomenon and there is a clear social gradient in the prevalence of energy drink consumption where the intake is far more common among people with low levels of education than among people with higher levels of education. This study also shows that there is some kind of 'add on' effect of energy drinks, meaning that people who also use other stimulants-such as alcohol and cigarettes-are more inclined to consume energy drinks.

AB Objective: The aims of the present work were to study beverage consumption among obese women from rural communities in Mexico and to estimate daily polyphenol intake and dietary antioxidant capacity from beverages.
   Design: A cross-sectional study was used to analyse the beverage intake of 139 premenopausal obese women estimated through repeated 24 h food recalls. Total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity were determined in eighteen beverages, representing 71% of total beverage consumption, in order to estimate the intake of polyphenols (mg/person per cl) and the dietary antioxidant capacity (mu mol Trolox equivalents/person per d) from beverages.
   Setting: Five rural communities located in Queretaro State, Mexico, in 2008.
   Subjects: A total of 139 premenopausal women identified as obese (BMI 35.0 (SE 0.4) kg/m(2)), aged 25-45 years.
   Results: The contribution of beverages to dietary energy was 1369 kJ/d (18% of total energy intake). Soft drinks were consumed the most (283 (SE 17) ml/d), followed by coffee and fresh fruit beverages. Polyphenol intake and dietary antioxidant capacity from beverages was 180.9 (SE 12.5) mg/person per d and >1000 mu mol Trolox equivalents/person per cl, respectively. The items that contributed most to this intake were coffee, roselle chink, peach and guava juices and infusions.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among obese women from rural Mexico. Low-sugar beverages rich in polyphenols and antioxidants may be healthier options to replace sweetened drinks and increase the intake of bioactive compounds. Nutritional advice on this topic could be a viable strategy to tackle obesity in rural areas in Mexico.

AB Purpose: This national study was conducted to examine healthy eating programs, healthy eating education, and the food retail environments of schools.
   Methods: A total of 436 Canadian schools were studied. Administrators completed a questionnaire designed to assess school healthy eating programs, healthy eating education, and food retail environment. The number of chain fast food restaurants, chain cafes/coffee shops, and convenience stores within 1 km of schools was measured using geographic information systems food retailer measures from DMTI Spatial Inc. and the Yellow Pages.
   Results: During the preceding year, 67% of schools had initiated healthy eating lunch programs while 18% had junk food-free days. The majority of schools offered cooking classes (59%) and healthy eating media literacy education (67%), while a minority offered gardening activities (15%) and field trips to farmers' markets (27%) and grocery stores (36%). Fifty-three percent had a school cafeteria, and most had a school tuck shop (75%) and pop/juice vending machines (76%). Fifty percent had a chain fast food restaurant, 33% had a chain cafe/coffee shop, and 41% had a convenience store within 1 km.
   Conclusions: An important aspect of addressing childhood obesity will be improving the food environments of schools and their surrounding neighbourhoods, and providing healthy eating education for all students.

AB The popularity of energy drinks has increased rapidly in the past decade. One of the main reasons people use energy drinks is to counteract effects of insufficient sleep or sleepiness. Risks associated with energy drink use, including those related to sleep loss, may be disproportionately borne by racial minorities and those of lower socioeconomic status. In this review, a brief introduction to the issue of health disparities is provided, population-level disparities and inequalities in sleep are described, and the social-ecological model of sleep and health is presented. Social and demographic patterns of energy drink use are then presented, followed by discussion of the potential ways in which energy drink use may contribute to health disparities, including the following: 1) effects of excessive caffeine in energy drinks, 2) effects of energy drinks as sugar-sweetened beverages, 3) association between energy drinks and risk-taking behaviors when mixed with alcohol, 4) association between energy drink use and short sleep duration, and 5) role of energy drinks in cardiometabolic disease. The review concludes with a research agenda of critical unanswered questions. (C) 2014 International Life Sciences Institute

AB Several concentrations of theobromine (TB) and (-)-epicatechin (EC) were coadministered to rats, and plasma EC and its metabolites were determined using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. It has been demonstrated that TB increases the absorption of EC in a dose-dependent manner. Cocoa powder had a similar effect, and the mechanism involved is not thought to depend on tight junctions.

AB Aim: Different intervention strategies can prevent type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies.
   Methods: Studies were grouped into 15 different strategies: 1: diet plus physical activity; 2: physical activity; 3-6: anti-diabetic drugs [glitazones, metformin, beta-cell stimulating drugs (sulphanylureas, glinides), alfa-glucosidase inhibitors]; 7-8: cardiovascular drugs (ACE inhibitors, ARB, calcium antagonists); 9-14 [diets, lipid-affecting drugs (orlistat, bezafibrate), vitamins, micronutrients, estrogens, alcohol, coffee]; 15: bariatric surgery. Only controlled studies were included in the analysis, whether randomized, non-randomized, observational studies, whether primarily designed to assess incident cases of diabetes, or performed with other purposes, such as control of hypertension, of ischemic heart disease or prevention of cardiovascular events. Appropriate methodology [preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement] was used. Seventy-one studies (490 813 subjects), published as full papers, were analysed to identify predictors of new cases of T2DM, and were included in a meta-analysis (random-effects model) to study the effect of different strategies. Intervention effect (new cases of diabetes) was expressed as odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (C. I. s). Publication bias was formally assessed.
   Results: Body mass index was in the overweight range for 13 groups, obese or morbidly obese in lipid-affecting drugs and in bariatric surgery. Non-surgical strategies, except for beta-cell stimulating drugs, estrogens and vitamins, were able to prevent T2DM, with different effectiveness, from 0.37 (C. I. 0.26-0.52) to 0.85 (C. I. 0.77-0.93); the most effective strategy was bariatric surgery in morbidly obese subjects [0.16 (C. I. 0.11,0.24)]. At meta-regression analysis, age of subjects and amount of weight lost were associated with effectiveness of intervention.
   Conclusions: These data indicate that several strategies prevent T2DM, making it possible to make a choice for the individual subject.

AB Background: Higenamine, also known as norcoclaurine, is an herbal constituent thought to act as a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist-possibly stimulating lipolysis. It was the purpose of this study to determine the impact of a higenamine-based dietary supplement on plasma free fatty acids and energy expenditure following acute oral ingestion.
   Methods: Sixteen healthy subjects (8 men; 26.1 +/- 2.5 yrs; 8 women 22.4 +/- 3.1 yrs) ingested a dietary supplement containing a combination of higenamine, caffeine (270 mg), and yohimbe bark extract or a placebo, on two separate occasions in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design, separated by 6-8 days. Blood samples were collected immediately before ingestion, and at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes post ingestion, and analyzed for plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol. Breath samples were collected at the same times for a measure of kilocalorie expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) using indirect calorimetry. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at all times. Data collection occurred in the morning following a 10 hour overnight fast.
   Results: A condition effect was noted for both FFA (p < 0.0001) and kilocalorie expenditure (p = 0.001), with values higher for supplement compared to placebo at 60, 120, and 180 minutes post ingestion. No statistically significant effects were noted for glycerol or RER (p > 0.05). A condition effect was noted for heart rate (p = 0.03) and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.0001), with values higher for supplement compared to placebo.
   Conclusion: Ingestion of a higenamine-based dietary supplement stimulates lipolysis and energy expenditure, as evidenced by a significant increase in circulating FFA and kilocalorie expenditure. The same supplement results in a moderate increase in heart rate (similar to 3 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (similar to 12 mmHg), which is consistent with previous studies evaluating moderate doses of caffeine and yohimbine, suggesting that higenamine contributes little to the increase in these hemodynamic variables. These findings are in reference to young, healthy and active men and women.

AB Athrixia phylicoides DC. is an aromatic shrub indigenous to the eastern parts of Southern Africa. Indigenous communities brew "bush tea" from dried twigs and leaves of A. phylicoides, which is consumed as a beverage and used for its medicinal properties. Plant polyphenols have been shown to be beneficial to Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and obesity. Aqueous extracts of the plant have been shown to be rich in polyphenols, in particular phenolic acids, which may enhance glucose uptake and metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine the phenolic composition of a hot water A. phylicoides extract and assess its in vitro effect on cellular glucose utilisation. The most abundant phenolic compounds in the extract were 6-hydroxyluteolin-7-O-glucoside, chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, a di-caffeoylquinic acid and a methoxy-flavonol derivative. The extract increased glucose uptake in C2C12, Chang and 3T3-L1 cells, respectively. Intracellular glucose was utilised by both oxidation (C2C12 myocytes and Chang cells; p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) and by increased glycogen storage (Chang cells; p < 0.05). No cytotoxicity was observed in Chang cells at the concentrations tested. The effects of the extract were not dose-dependent. A. phylicoides aqueous extract stimulated in vitro glucose uptake and metabolism, suggesting that consumption of this phenolic-rich extract could potentially ameliorate metabolic disorders related to obesity and T2D.

AB Anthocyanins and phenolic acids are major secondary metabolites in blueberry with important implications for human health maintenance. An improved protocol was developed for the accurate, efficient, and rapid comparative screening for large blueberry sample sets. Triplicates of six commercial cultivars and four breeding selections were analyzed using the new method. The compound recoveries ranged from 94.2 to 97.5 +/- 5.3% when samples were spiked with commercial standards prior to extraction. Eighteen anthocyanins and 4 phenolic acids were quantified in frozen and freeze-dried fruits. Large variations for individual and total anthocyanins, ranging from 201.4 to 402.8 mg/100 g, were assayed in frozen fruits. The total phenolic acid content ranged from 23.6 to 61.7 mg/100 g in frozen fruits. Across all genotypes, freeze-drying resulted in minor reductions in anthocyanin concentration (3.9%) compared to anthocyanins in frozen fruits. However, phenolic acids increased by an average of 1.9-fold (+/- 0.3) in the freeze-dried fruit. Different genotypes frequently had comparable overall levels of total anthocyanins and phenolic acids, but differed dramatically in individual profiles of compounds. Three of the genotypes contained markedly higher concentrations of delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, and malvidin 3-0-glucoside, which have previously been implicated as bioactive principles in this fruit The implications of these findings for human health benefits are discussed.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of black chokeberry (Aronia melanoccopa L.) extract on the activity of porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase and lipase. An in vitro study demonstrated that three kinds of chokeberry extracts: methanolic, water and acetic caused inhibition of alpha-amylase and lipase. The methanolic and acetic extracts exhibited the highest inhibitory activities against alpha-amylase with the IC50 values of 10.31 +/- 0.04 mg/ml and pancreatic lipase 83.45 +/- 0.50 mg/ml, respectively. In order to identify the compounds which may be the potential inhibitors of alpha-amylase and lipase, chokeberry extract was analyzed by preparative reverse phase chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). These studies have shown that both anthocyanins and phenolic acids are compounds which inhibit the ability of the reaction catalyzed by alpha-amylase and lipase. The most effective inhibitor of pancreatic alpha-amylase was chlorogenic acid (IC50= 0.57 +/- 0.16 mg/ml). In the group of anthocyanins the most potent inhibitor of alpha-amylase was cyanidin-3-glucoside (IC50= 1.74 +/- 0.04 mg/ml), which also showed an ability to inhibit the reaction catalyzed by pancreatic lipase(IC50 = 1.17 +/- 0.05 mg/ml). These findings seem to indicate the use of chokeberry as a functional food component, contributing to its anti-obesity activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sucrose increases postprandial blood glucose concentrations, and diets with a high glycaemic response may be associated with increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and CVD. Previous studies have suggested that polyphenols may influence carbohydrate digestion and absorption and thereby postprandial glycaemia. Berries are rich sources of various polyphenols and berry products are typically consumed with sucrose. We investigated the glycaemic effect of a berry puree made of bilberries, blackcurrants, cranberries and strawberries, and sweetened with sucrose, in comparison to sucrose with adjustment of available carbohydrates. A total of twelve healthy subjects (eleven women and one man, aged 25-69 years) with normal fasting plasma glucose ingested 150 g of the berry puree with 35 g sucrose or a control sucrose load in a randomised, controlled cross-over design. After consumption of the berry meal, the plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower at 15 and 30 min (P<0.05, P<0.01, respectively) and significantly higher at 150 min (P<0.05) compared with the control meal. The peak glucose concentration was reached at 45 min after the berry meal and at 30 min after the control meal. The peak increase from the baseline was 1.0 mmol/l smaller (P=0.002) after ingestion of the berry meal. There was no statistically significant difference in the 3 h area under the glucose response curve. These results show that berries rich in polyphenols decrease the postprandial glucose response of sucrose in healthy subjects. The delayed and attenuated glycaemic response indicates reduced digestion and/or absorption of sucrose from the berry meal.

AB The global prevalence of obesity has increased considerably in the last decade. Tools for obesity management, including consumption of caffeine, capsaicin and different teas such as green, white and oolong tea, have been proposed as strategies for weight loss and weight maintenance, as they may increase energy expenditure (4-5%), fat oxidation (10-16%) and have been proposed to counteract the decrease in metabolic rate that is present during weight loss. Daily increases in thermogenesis of approximately 300-400 kJ can eventually lead to substantial weight loss. However, it becomes clearer that certain conditions have to be met before thermogenic ingredients yield an effect, as intra-variability with respect to body weight regulation has been shown between subjects. Furthermore, the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the regulation of lipolysis, and the sympathetic innervation of white adipose tissue may have an important role in the regulation of total body fat in general. Taken together, these functional ingredients have the potential to produce significant effects on metabolic targets such as satiety, thermogenesis and fat oxidation. A significant clinical outcome may sometimes appear straightforward and may also depend very strongly on full compliance of subjects. Nevertheless, thermogenic ingredients may be considered as functional agents that could help in preventing a positive energy balance and obesity.

AB In this study, we investigated the antioxidant and anti-adipogenic activities of aqueous extracts of mugwort and pine needles fermented by Leuconostoc mesenteroides 1076. We also evaluated the phenolic composition, total phenolic content and flavonoid contents of both the fermented mugwort extract (FME) and fermented pine needle extract (FPE). The antioxidant potentials of the FME and FPE were assessed using various antioxidant assays, including the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical assay, the 2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylenebenzothiozoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assay, the ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, and the reducing power assay. In addition, the anti-adipogenic effects of the FME and FPE were investigated during the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. Our results showed that the total phenolic contents of the FME and FPE were 182 +/- 4 and 116 +/- 5 mg GAE/g, respectively. Among the phenolic compounds, chlorogenic acid was found to be the major phenolic acid in the FPE, whereas hesperetin was found to be the major phenolic acid in the FME. The antioxidant activities of the FME and FPE increased in a dose-dependent manner. The FME exhibited higher antioxidant activities than the FPE. Furthermore, both the FME and FPE inhibited lipid accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which involved the down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), adipocyte protein 2 (aP2) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) mRNA expression. These results indicated that the FPE and FME could be useful in the treatment of obesity and as natural sources of antioxidants.

AB Cette etude se propose d'analyser les effets combines d'un programme d'exercices de 10 semaines et de la consommation de cafeine additionnee d'epigallocatechine-3-gallate (EGCG) sur la composition corporelle, la condition physique cardiovasculaire et la force chez des femmes presentant un surplus de poids et des femmes obeses. Selon un devis experimental a double insu, des femmes presentant un surpoids et des femmes obeses (n = 27) sont assignees aleatoirement dans 4 groupes : un groupe avec supplementation et exercice (EX-Act), un groupe placebo, soit sans supplementation, mais avec exercice (EX-PL), un groupe avec supplementation, mais sans exercice (NEX-Act) et un autre groupe placebo, soit sans supplementation ni exercice (NEX-PL). Toutes les participantes consomment une boisson par jour durant 10 semaines; les groupes EX-Act et EX-PL participent a un programme combine d'endurance et de force. Les variations de composition corporelle sont evaluees en fonction d'un modele a quatre compartiments. Les variations de la masse musculaire (MM) sont determinees au moyen d'une equation determinant la masse maigre des tissus mous appendiculaires obtenue par DXA. On observe une interaction significative traitement temps en ce qui concerne la MM (p = 0,026) et la concentration totale de cholesterol (TC) (p = 0,047); on observe aussi une interaction significative traitement temps en ce qui concerne le consommation d'oxygene de pointe (p = 0,046) et la force du haut et du bas du corps (p < 0,05). En outre, on observe des differences significatives entre les groupes EX et NEX en ce qui concerne les variations en pourcentage de la MM, du le consommation d'oxygene de pointe et de la force du haut et du bas du corps. Les marqueurs cliniques des fonctions hepatique et renale ne revelent aucun effet indesirable. La TC diminue significativement dans les groupes recevant des supplements (EX-Act, NEX-Act). Cette etude indique que boire un breuvage contenant de la cafeine et du EGCG avant l'exercice dans un programme d'entrainement physique contribue a l'amelioration de la masse musculaire, de la condition physique et du bilan lipidique chez des femmes presentant un surpoids et des femmes obeses.

AB The present multi-centre randomised weight-loss trial evaluated the efficacy of a low-intensity 12-week online behavioural modification programme, with or without a fortified diet beverage using a 2x2 factorial design. A total of 572 participants were randomised to: (1) an online basic lifestyle information (OBLI) intervention, consisting of one online informational class about tips for weight management; (2) an online behavioural weight management (OBWM) intervention, entailing 12 weekly online classes focused on weight-loss behaviour modification; (3) an OBLI intervention plus a fortified diet cola beverage (BEV) containing green tea extract (total catechin 167mg), soluble fibre dextrin (10g) and caffeine (100mg) (OBLI+BEV); (4) OBWM+BEV. Assessments included height, weight, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-derived body composition, and waist circumference (WC). Attrition was 15 center dot 7%. Intention-to-treat (ITT) models demonstrated a main effect for type of Internet programme, with those assigned to the OBWM condition losing significantly more weight (F=7 center dot 174; P=0 center dot 008) and fat mass (F=4 center dot 491; P=0 center dot 035) than those assigned to the OBLI condition. However, there was no significant main effect for the OBWM condition on body fat percentage (F=2 center dot 906; P=0 center dot 089) or WC (F=3 center dot 351; P=0 center dot 068), and no significant main effect for beverage use or significant interactions between factors in ITT models. A 12-week, low-intensity behaviourally based online programme produced a greater weight loss than a basic information website. The addition of a fortified diet beverage had no additional impact.

AB Objectives. To examine the relationship between "traditional Sami" dietary pattern and mortality in a general northern Swedish population.
   Study design. Population-based cohort study.
   Methods. We examined 77,319 subjects from the Vasterbotten Intervention Program (VIP) cohort. A traditional Sami diet score was constructed by adding 1 point for intake above the median level of red meat, fatty fish, total fat, berries and boiled coffee, and 1 point for intake below the median of vegetables, bread and fibre. Hazard ratios (HR) for mortality were calculated by Cox regression.
   Results. Increasing traditional Sami diet scores were associated with slightly elevated all-cause mortality in men [Multivariate HR per 1-point increase in score 1.04 (95% CI 1.01-1.07), p = 0.018], but not for women [Multivariate HR 1.03 (95% CI 0.99-1.07), p = 0.130]. This increased risk was approximately equally attributable to cardiovascular disease and cancer, though somewhat more apparent for cardiovascular disease mortality in men free from diabetes, hypertension and obesity at baseline [Multivariate HR 1.10 (95% CI 1.01 1.20), p = 0.023].
   Conclusions. A weak increased all-cause mortality was observed in men with higher traditional Sami diet scores. However, due to the complexity in defining a "traditional Sami" diet, and the limitations of our questionnaire for this purpose, the study should be considered exploratory, a first attempt to relate a "traditional Sami" dietary pattern to health endpoints. Further investigation of cohorts with more detailed information on dietary and lifestyle items relevant for traditional Sami culture is warranted.

TI Cardio- and cerebrovascular responses to the energy drink Red

AB Energy drinks are beverages containing vasoactive metabolites, usually a combination of caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone and sugars. There are concerns about the safety of energy drinks with some countries banning their sales. We determined the acute effects of a popular energy drink, Red Bull, on cardiovascular and hemodynamic variables, cerebrovascular parameters and microvascular endothelial function.
   Twenty-five young non-obese and healthy subjects attended two experimental sessions on separate days according to a randomized crossover study design. During each session, primary measurements included beat-to-beat blood pressure measurements, impedance cardiography and transcranial Doppler measurements for at least 20 min baseline and for 2 h following the ingestion of either 355 mL of the energy drink or 355 mL of tap water; the endothelial function test was performed before and two hours after either drink.
   Unlike the water control load, Red Bull consumption led to increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.005), associated with increased heart rate and cardiac output (p < 0.05), with no significant changes in total peripheral resistance and without diminished endothelial response to acetylcholine; consequently, double product (reflecting myocardial load) was increased (p < 0.005). Red Bull consumption also led to increases in cerebrovascular resistance and breathing frequency (p < 0.005), as well as to decreases in cerebral blood flow velocity (p < 0.005) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (p < 0.005).
   Our results show an overall negative hemodynamic profile in response to ingestion of the energy drink Red Bull, in particular an elevated blood pressure and double product and a lower cerebral blood flow velocity.

AB Background: Few previous studies investigated consumption distributions of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) over time and individual-level associations in Asia despite the recent interest in SSBs regarding obesity control. This study aimed to provide recent evidence on beverage consumption trends from 2001 to 2009 for overall and subtypes of SSBs and for milk as a comparable healthy beverage in South Korea, as well as associations with individual-level socioeconomic status (SES).
   Methods: The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2001 to 2009 were used. Consumption prevalence and average caloric intake by SSB type were examined. Associations of SES with consumption were assessed in a multivariate logistic regression model (consumption prevalence) and in a multivariate two-part regression model (overall caloric intake adjusting for consumption probability).
   Results: SSB consumption prevalence increased to 38%, 69%, 70%, and 50% by 2009 up from 31%, 66%, 63%, and 32% in 2001 among adolescents, young adults, adults, and the elderly, respectively. Miscellaneous SSBs (sports/energy drinks, coffee/tea products, flavored milk, and others) were the most prevalent and their prevalence increased among adults (from 62% to 69%) and the elderly (from 30% to 47%) between 2001 and 2009. Adolescents consumed the most calories from miscellaneous SSBs among all beverage types although its prevalence was lower than regular soda and milk in both 2001 and 2009. Women (top-income group only) and men in higher income groups showed higher odds of consuming total SSBs (OR = 1.18-1.25), soda (OR = 1.18, men only), fruit drinks (OR = 1.18, the top-income only for both genders), and miscellaneous SSBs (OR = 1.1-1.2). Men with higher-education showed higher odds of total SSB consumption (OR = 1.14-1.20), and all subtypes of SSBs (OR = 1.18, 1.29, 1.19 for soda, fruit drinks, and miscellaneous SSBs, respectively for the top-education group only). There were statistically significant but minimal differences in the overall amount of caloric intake from SSBs by individual SES for both genders.
   Conclusions: South Korea is following the global nutrition transition toward greater consumption of SSBs. However, unlike other developed countries, SSB consumption prevalence was higher among high-SES individuals, particularly for fruit drinks and miscellaneous SSBs. Further research is needed to build the international evidence base.

AB The involvement of sympathoadrenal axis activity in obesity onset was investigated using the experimental model of treating neonatal rats with monosodium L-glutamate. To access general sympathetic nervous system activity, we recorded the firing rates of sympathetic superior cervical ganglion nerves in animals. Catecholamine content and secretion from isolated adrenal medulla were measured. Intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed, and isolated pancreatic islets were stimulated with glucose and adrenergic agonists. The nerve firing rate of obese rats was decreased compared to the rate for lean rats. Basal catecholamine secretion decreased whereas catecholamine secretion induced by carbachol, elevated extracellular potassium, and caffeine in the isolated adrenal medulla were all increased in obese rats compared to control. Both glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinaemia were observed in obese rats. Adrenaline strongly inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion in obese animals. These findings suggest that low sympathoadrenal activity contributes to impaired glycaemic control in prediabetic obese rats.

AB Background: The primary study objective was to examine whether the presence of food retailers surrounding schools was associated with students' lunchtime eating behaviours. The secondary objective was to determine whether measures of the food retail environment around schools captured using road network or circular buffers were more strongly related to eating behaviours while at school.
   Methods: Grade 9 and 10 students (N=6,971) who participated in the 2009/10 Canadian Health Behaviour in School Aged Children Survey were included in this study. The outcome was determined by students' self-reports of where they typically ate their lunch during school days. Circular and road network-based buffers were created for a 1 km distance surrounding 158 schools participating in the HBSC. The addresses of fast food restaurants, convenience stores and coffee/donut shops were mapped within the buffers. Multilevel logistic regression was used to determine whether there was a relationship between the presence of food retailers near schools and students regularly eating their lunch at a fast food restaurant, snack-bar or cafe. The Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) value, a measure of goodness-of-fit, was used to determine the optimal buffer type.
   Results: For the 1 km circular buffers, students with 1-2 (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 0.57-2.11), 3-4 (OR=1.45, 95% CI: 0.75-2.82) and >= 5 nearby food retailers (OR=2.94, 95% CI: 1.71-5.09) were more likely to eat lunch at a food retailer compared to students with no nearby food retailers. The relationships were slightly stronger when assessed via 1 km road network buffers, with a greater likelihood of eating at a food retailer for 1-2 (OR=1.20, 95% CI: 0.74-1.95), 3-4 (OR=3.19, 95% CI: 1.66-6.13) and >= 5 nearby food retailers (OR=3.54, 95% CI: 2.08-6.02). Road network buffers appeared to provide a better measure of the food retail environment, as indicated by a lower AIC value (3332 vs. 3346).
   Conclusions: There was a strong relationship between the presence of food retailers near schools and students' lunchtime eating behaviours. Results from the goodness of fit analysis suggests that road network buffers provide a more optimal measure of school neighbourhood food environments relative to circular buffers.

AB Background. Inuit in Arctic regions are experiencing a rapid diet and lifestyle transition. There are limited data on food consumption patterns among this unique population, raising concerns about assessing the risk for the development of diet-related chronic diseases. Objective. To assess the current frequency of consumption of foods and beverages among Inuit in Nunavut, Arctic Canada.
   Methods. A cross-sectional dietary study was conducted among randomly selected Inuit adults from three communities in Nunavut using a validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The participants were 175 women and 36 men with median (IQR) ages of 41.0(32.5-48.5) and 40.1 (30.0-50.0) years, respectively. The mean and median frequencies of consumption over a 30-day period were computed for 147 individual food items and grouped as foods or beverages.
   Results. The 30 most frequently consumed foods were identified. Non-nutrient-dense foods (i.e., high-fat and high-sugar foods) were the most frequently consumed food group (median intake, 3.4 times/day), followed by grains (2.0 times/day) and traditional meats (1.7 times/day). The frequency of consumption of fruits (0.7 times/day) and vegetables (0.4 times/day) was low The median values for the three most frequently consumed food items were sugar or honey (once/day), butter (0.71 times/day), and Coffee-mate (0.71 times/day). Apart from water, coffee, and tea, the most frequently consumed beverages were sweetened juices (0.71 times/day) and regular pop (soft drinks) (0.36 times/day).This study showed that non-nutrient-dense foods are consumed most frequently in these Inuit communities.
   Conclusions. The results have implications for dietary quality and provide useful information on current dietary practices to guide nutritional intervention programs.

AB Literature on the diet of the Mexican-American population suggests that food consumption differs by nativity and duration of residence in the United States. However, no studies have used dietary pattern analysis to investigate these differences. To create dietary patterns, we used principal components analysis on food frequency questionnaire data for all adult respondents of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey years 2003-2006. Four dietary patterns were identified: Western, Healthy, Tomato/Tortilla, and Coffee/Sugar. Least squares means regression was used to test differences in adjusted mean dietary adherence scores among Mexico-born Mexican-American adults residing in the United States for <15 years (n=302), Mexico-born Mexican-American adults residing in the United States for a 15 years (n=234), US-born Mexican-American adults (n= 509), and US-born non-Hispanic whites (n=2,530) aged 18 to 69 years. Mean score for each diet pattern did not differ significantly by duration of US residence category in the Mexico-born Mexican-American population. However, in comparison to all Mexico-born Mexican Americans, US-born Mexican Americans had significantly lower score for the Tomato/Tortilla pattern, and significantly higher score for the Western pattern. Scores for the Healthy pattern were relatively low in all Mexican-American subgroups, indicating low adherence to the Healthy diet. However, Healthy diet scores of Mexico-born Mexican Americans among those aged :541 years appeared more similar to those of US-born non-Hispanic whites than US-born Mexican Americans.

AB Tissue-specific amplification of glucocorticoid action through 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 beta-HSD1) affects the development of the metabolic syndrome. Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH) mediates intracellular NADPH availability for 11 beta-HSD1 and depends on the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT). Little is known about the tissue-specific alterations of H6PDH and G6PT and their contributions to local glucocorticoid action in db/db mice.
   We characterised the role of H6PDH and G6PT in pre-receptor metabolism of glucocorticoids by examining the production of the hepatic 11 beta-HSD1-H6PDH-G6PT system in db/db mice.
   We observed that increased production of hepatic H6PDH in db/db mice was paralleled by upregulation of hepatic G6PT production and responded to elevated circulating levels of corticosterone. Treatment of db/db mice with the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 markedly reduced production of both H6PDH and 11 beta-HSD1 and improved hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. The reduction of H6PDH and 11 beta-HSD1 production by RU486 was accompanied by RU486-induced suppression of hepatic G6pt (also known as Slc37a4) mRNA. Incubation of mouse primary hepatocytes with corticosterone enhanced G6PT and H6PDH production with corresponding activation of 11 beta-HSD1 and PEPCK: effects that were blocked by RU486. Knockdown of H6pd by small interfering RNA showed effects comparable with those of RU486 for attenuating the corticosterone-induced H6PDH production and 11-HSD1 reductase activity in these intact cells. Addition of the G6PT inhibitor chlorogenic acid to primary hepatocytes suppressed H6PDH production.
   These findings suggest that increased hepatic H6PDH and G6PT production contribute to 11 beta-HSD1 upregulation of local glucocorticoid action that may be related to the development of type 2 diabetes.

AB Objective: To examine the validity and reproducibility of food groups in the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed for the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS).
   Methods: To evaluate the reproducibility of food groups included in the FFQ, 132 Subjects (61 men and 71 women) aged 20 years or older twice completed a 168-item FFQ (FFQ1, FFQ2), with a 14-month interval between FFQ1 and FFQ2. Over the 1-year interval, 12 dietary recalls (DRs) were collected (1 each month) to assess the validity of the FFQ. Seventeen food groups were derived front the FFQ based on methods described in previous studies. Age-adjusted and deattenuated Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the validity of the FFQ.
   Results: The mean (SD) age and body mass index of subjects were 35.5 (16.8) years and 25.5 (5.2)kg/m(2), respectively. Validity correlation coefficients ranged from 0.03 (liquid oil) to 0.77 (simple Sugars) in men (median, 0.44), and from 0.12 (snacks) to 0.79 (simple Sugars) in women (median, 0.37). The energy-adjusted intraclass correlation coefficient, which reflects the reproducibility of the FFQ, was 0.51 in men and was highest for tea and coffee (0.91); in women it vas 0.59 and was highest for simple sugars (0.74). The highest percentage of complete agreement and disagreement was observed for snacks and desserts (60.6%) and potatoes and dairy products (12.8%), respectively, in men, and tea and coffee (62.9%) and legumes (15.7%) in women.
   Conclusions: The FFQ that was designed for the TLGS was found to be reliable and valid for assessing the intake of several food groups.

AB In-store product placement is perceived to be a factor underpinning impulsive food purchasing but empirical evidence is limited. In this study we present the first in-depth estimate of the effect of end-of-aisle display on sales, focussing on alcohol. Data on store layout and product-level sales during 2010-11 were obtained for one UK grocery store, comprising detailed information on shelf space, price, price promotion and weekly sales volume in three alcohol categories (beer, wine, spirits) and three non-alcohol categories (carbonated drinks, coffee, tea). Multiple regression techniques were used to estimate the effect of end-of-aisle display on sales, controlling for price, price promotion, and the number of display locations for each product. End-of-aisle display increased sales volumes in all three alcohol categories: by 23.2% (p = 0.005) for beer, 33.6% (p < 0.001) for wine, and 46.1% (p < 0.001) for spirits, and for three non-alcohol beverage categories: by 51.7% (p < 0.001) for carbonated drinks, 73.5% (p < 0.001) for coffee, and 113.8% (p < 0.001) for tea. The effect size was equivalent to a decrease in price of between 4% and 9% per volume for alcohol categories, and a decrease in price of between 22% and 62% per volume for non-alcohol categories. End-of-aisle displays appear to have a large impact on sales of alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages. Restricting the use of aisle ends for alcohol and other less healthy products might be a promising option to encourage healthier in-store purchases, without affecting availability or cost of products.

AB Tea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae) is the second most consumed beverages in the world, next to water in terms of worldwide popularity. The chemical components of green tea chiefly include polyphenols, caffeine, and amino acids. Green tea is rich in catechins, of which (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate is the most abundant. As described in literature, green tea and its polyphenols are beneficial in curing a wide variety of diseases like cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, etc. It also has antimicrobial activity, protects from solar radiations, and possesses neuroprotective properties. The current review article focuses on pharmacological profile associated with Green tea and its polyphenols. We hope that this review will expose areas for further study and encourage research on important public health issue.

AB With more than 8000 polyphenols found in food (mainly, wine, tea, coffee, cocoa, vegetables and cereals), many epidemiological studies suggest that the intake of polyphenol-rich foods has a beneficial effect on a large number of cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and smoking. The mechanisms involved in the cardioprotective effects of polyphenols are numerous and include antioxidant, vasodilator, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, antiapoptotic and metabolic. Most importantly, recent experimental data demonstrate that polyphenols can exert its cardioprotective effect via the activation of several powerful prosurvival cellular pathways that involve metabolic intermediates, microRNAs, sirtuins and mediators of the recently described reperfusion injury salvage kinases (RISK) and survivor activating factor enhancement (SAFE) pathways.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to determine the relative validity of the self-administered Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) "What do you eat?", which was used in the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS 2003-2006).
   Methods: The validation was conducted in the EsKiMo Nutrition Module, a subsample of KiGGS. The study population included 1,213 adolescents aged between 12 and 17. A modified diet history interview DISHES (Dietary Interview Software for Health Examination Studies) was used as the reference method. In order to compare the food groups, the data assessed with both instruments were aggregated to 40 similar food groups. The statistical analysis included calculating and comparing Spearman's correlation coefficients, calculating the mean difference between both methods, and ranking participants (quartiles) according to food group consumption, including weighted kappa coefficients. Correlations were also evaluated for relative body weight and socioeconomic status subgroups.
   Results: In the total study population the Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from 0.22 for pasta/rice to 0.69 for margarine; most values were 0.50 and higher. The mean difference ranged between 1.4% for milk and 100.3% for pasta/rice. The 2.5 percentiles and 97.5 percentiles indicated a wide range of differences. Classifications in the same and adjacent quartile varied between 70.1% for pasta/rice and 90.8% for coffee. For most groups, Cohen's weighted kappa showed values between 0.21 and 0.60. Only for white bread and pasta/rice were values less than 0.20. Most of the 40 food groups showed acceptable to good correlations in all investigated subgroups concerning age, sex, body weight and socio-economic status.
   Conclusions: The KiGGS FFQ showed fair to moderate ranking validity except for pasta/rice and white bread. However, the ability to assess absolute intakes is limited. The correlation coefficients for most food items were similar for normal weight and overweight as well as for different socio-economic status groups. Overall, the results of the relative validity were comparable to FFQs from the current literature.

We analyzed a single 24-h dietary recall from 2 nationally representative surveys: the Mexican Nutrition Survey 1999 (n = 6049) and the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 (n = 10,343). To describe trends and patterns in beverages, we calculated the volume and energy intake per capita and per consumer and the proportion of consumers of each beverage group in each survey. A commercial sales dataset was used to describe beverage sales trends from 1999 to 2012. From 1999 to 2012, total daily energy from beverages increased among children aged 5-11 y (+45.3 kcal), females aged 12-19 y (+57.3 kcal), and adult females aged 20-49 y (+96.4 kcal) (P < 0.05). Over the same period, intake of beverages with added sugars increased, specifically flavored milk, agua fresca (fruit water made in stalls or at home, usually with added sugars), and fruit drinks among children aged 5-11 y and females aged 12-19 y and caloric coffee/tea, soda, and agua fresca among adult females aged 20-49 y. In 2012, beverages represented 17.5% (325 kcal) and 19.0% (382 kcal) of the total daily energy intake per capita in children aged 1-19 y and adults aged >= 20 y, respectively. In 2012, flavored milk beverages, caloric soda, and high-fat milk were the top 3 major contributors to total daily energy intake per capita in all children aged 1-19 y. Caloric soda, caloric coffee/tea, and agua fresca were the top 3 major energy contributors in adults aged >= 20 y. From 1999 to 2012, sales of soda, fruit-flavored drinks, and flavored waters increased. In conclusion, consumption of several beverages with added sugars increased among children and adult females in Mexico. Because caloric soda is currently 1 of the top beverages consumed, a 10% tax on SSBs might help to significantly reduce added sugars intake in Mexico.

AB Background: International comparisons of dietary intake are an important source of information to better understand food habits and their relationship to nutrition related diseases. The objective of this study is to compare food intake of Brazilian adults with American adults identifying possible dietary factors associated with the increase in obesity in Brazil.
   Methods: This research used cross-national analyses between the United States and Brazil, including 5,420 adults in the 2007-2008 What We Eat In America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and 26,390 adults in the 2008-2009 Brazilian Household Budget Survey, Individual Food Intake. Dietary data were collected through 24 h recalls in the U. S. and through food records in Brazil. Foods and beverages were combined into 25 food categories. Food intake means and percentage of energy contribution by food categories to the population's total energy intake were compared between the countries.
   Results: Higher frequencies of intake were reported in the United States compared to Brazil for the majority of food categories except for meat, rice and rice dishes; beans and legumes; spreads; and coffee and tea. In either country, young adults (20-39 yrs) had greater reports of meat, poultry and fish mixed dishes; pizza and pasta; and soft drinks compared to older adults (60 + yrs). Meat, poultry and fish mixed dishes (13%), breads (11%), sweets and confections (8%), pizza and pasta (7%), and dairy products (6%) were the top five food category sources of energy intake among American adults. The top five food categories in Brazil were rice and rice dishes (13%), meat (11%), beans and legumes (10%), breads (10%), and coffee and tea (6%). Thus, traditional plant-based foods such as rice and beans were important contributors in the Brazilian diet.
   Conclusion: Although young adults had higher reports of high-calorie and nutrient-poor foods than older adults in both countries, Brazilian young adults did not consume a diet similar to Americans, indicating that it is still possible to reverse the current trends of incorporating Western dietary habits in Brazil.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate whether a water extract of L. cladonioides (LC) has an anti-obesity effect in 3T3-L1 cells and obese mice. Treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with LC caused a significant increase in glycerol release and reduced the protein expression of the adipogenic transcription factors, PPAR gamma and C/EBPa. In an animal model, obese mice were artificially induced by a high fat diet for 10 weeks. Experimental groups were treated with LC (100 mg/kg/day) by gavage for the next 10 weeks. At the end of experiment, the body weight of the LC group mice was reduced by 14.2% compared to the high fat diet (HFD) group. The treatment also decreased liver (31.0%), epididymal (18.0%) and retroperitoneal (19.3%) adipose tissue, and kidney (6.7%) weights, respectively, compared with those of the RFD group. LC prevented diet-induced increases in the serum level of TC (22.6%), TG (11.6%), and glucose (35.0%), respectively, compared with the HFD group. However, the HDL-C level was higher in the LC group (26.1%) than the HFD group. The results of this study thus suggest that LC suppressed lipid accumulation and expression of adipogenic transcription factors, and increased the amount of glycerol release. LC also indicated an anti-obese and anti-hyperlipidemic effect.

AB Green tea catechins, especially (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), are known to regulate obesity and fat accumulation. We performed a kinetic analysis in a cell-free system to determine the mode of inhibition of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH; EC 1.1.1.8) by EGCG. GPDH catalyzes the beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dependent reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to yield glycerol-3-phosphate, which serves as one of the major precursors of triacylglycerols. We found that EGCG dose-dependently inhibited GPDH activity at a concentration of approximately 20 mu M for 50% inhibition. The IC50 values of other green tea catechins, such as (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate, and (-)-epigallocatechin, were all above 100 mu M. This suggests a catechin type-dependent effect. Based on double-reciprocal plots of the kinetic data, EGCG was a noncompetitive inhibitor of the GPDH substrates, NADH and DHAP, with respective inhibition constants (Ki) of 18 and 31 mu M. Results of this study possibly support previous studies that EGCG mediates fat content.

AB Knockout of Kv1.3 improves glucose homeostasis and confers resistance to obesity. Additionally, Kv1.3 inhibition enhances glucose uptake. This is thought to occur through calcium release. Kv1.3 inhibition in T-lymphocytes alters mitochondrial membrane potential, and, as many agents that induce Ca2+ release or inhibit mitochondrial function activate AMPK, we hypothesised that Kv1.3 inhibition would activate AMPK and increase glucose uptake. We screened cultured muscle with a range of Kv1.3 inhibitors for their ability to alter glucose uptake. Only Psora4 increased glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes. None of the inhibitors had any impact on L6 myotubes. Magratoxin activated AMPK in C2C12 myotubes and only Pap1 activated AMPK in the SOL. Kv1.3 inhibitors did not alter cellular respiration, indicating a lack of effect on mitochondrial function. In conclusion, AMPK does not mediate the effects of Kv1.3 inhibitors and they display differential effects in different skeletal muscle cell lines without impairing mitochondrial function.

AB Purpose of the study: Bofu-tsusho-San (Fang-feng-tong-sheng-san) has been used to treat obesity for about 700 years in China and Japan. In mice, the anti-obesity actions of Tsumura Bofu-tsusho-San extract granules (Tokyo, Japan)(TJ-62) have been shown to include promotion in brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis via l-ephedrine and d-pseudoephedrine, as well as inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity. And it was reported that TJ-62 has actions to decrease the weight and size gains of white adipose tissue (WAT) along with up-regulating uncoupling protein (UCP)1 mRNA in WAT of high-fat mice. We investigated in human activating thermogenesis of adipose tissue by TJ-62.
   Material and methods: We studied 6 healthy subjects. As control, we administered 150 ml of hot water (60 degrees C). On another day, we administered TJ-62 (5.0 g) and 150 ml of hot water (60 degrees C). We investigated the thermogenic effect of TJ-62 on human interscapular adipose tissue including BAT and WAT with a CM-210 (Terumo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
   Results: We found that the interscapular area of the back showed a higher temperature from 10 minutes after oral administration of TJ-62, and it was higher than after administration of the control. No significant changes of chest temperature occurred, an area where little adipose tissue exists.
   Conclusion: We think that the anti-obesity action of TJ-62 is based on activating thermogenesis of adipose tissue in human.

AB Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Rosemary) has been long claimed to have hypogylcemic-hypolipidemic dual effects in folkloric medicine. In an effort to explain rosemary's claimed benefits, numerous published studies have investigated an array of pharmacologic activities of the plant including anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic and metabolic effects. The question remained, however, as how rosemary would target both plasma lipids and glucose levels simultaneously. A newer mechanism has been suggested, in which targeting the hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) would be the common link between the two metabolic effects. In fact, HSL has been extensively studied for its effects on the metabolic switch between glucose and free fatty acids (FFAs) as an energy source. The current manuscript summarizes a significant amount of work that was undertaken to identify plant species native to Jordan with potential HSL and pancreatic lipase (PL) inhibitory activities. Our results demonstrated in vitro inhibitory effects of R. officnalis on both HSL and PL in a dose dependent manner. Interestingly, the rosemary extract had an IC50 for PL that was several fold lower than the IC50 for HSL, indicating a higher affinity to the former enzyme (13.8 and 95.2 mu g/mL for PL and HSL, respectively). In addition, we have compared the inhibitory activities of purified constituents found in rosemary to the parent plant [ rosmarinic acid (RA), chlorogenic acid (CA), caffeic acid (CaA) and gallic acid (GA)]. Our results showed that all the tested compounds (RA, CA, CaA, and GA) were able to inhibit the PL and HSL activities in a dose dependent manner, but with different potencies. PL and HSL IC50 values were calculated for each compound and GA was found to be the most potent (IC50 10.1 and 14.5 for PL and HSL, respectively). Further work is necessary to determine whether our in vitro findings would correlate with the in vivo effects. Nonetheless, our results are a first step in fully understanding the long claimed hypoglycemic-hypolipidemic dual effects of rosemary. Simultaneous targeting of both HSL and PL is likely to open the door for a new era in our continuous battle against DM type 2 and its cardiovascular complications. Currently we are working on identifying the most active constituents of the plant to evaluate a structure-activity relationship which would pave the road for future therapeutic use.

AB Green, white and black teas were assayed for inhibition of pancreatic lipase activity in vitro. White tea proved to be more effective than green tea with black tea showing little inhibition even at 200 mu g GAE/ml. The EC50 values for inhibition were 22 mu g/ml for white tea and 35 mu g/ml for green tea: both easily achievable from normal infusions of tea. Liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis showed that white and green teas had essentially equal amounts of flavan-3-ols but green tea had higher levels of flavonols. White tea had higher levels of 5-galloyl quinic acid, digalloyl glucose, trigalloyl glucose and the tannin, strictinin.
   After chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, the main inhibitory fraction was enriched in strictinin and fractions enriched in other components were ineffective. This suggests that strictinin content may be crucial for inhibition of pancreatic lipase. However, the possibility of synergies between the polyphenols cannot be disregarded.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the long-term relationship between changes in water and beverage intake and weight change.
   SUBJECTS: Prospective cohort studies of 50 013 women aged 40-64 years in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, 1986-2006), 52 987 women aged 27-44 years in the NHS II (1991-2007) and 21 988 men aged 40-64 years in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2006) without obesity and chronic diseases at baseline.
   MEASURES: We assessed the association of weight change within each 4-year interval, with changes in beverage intakes and other lifestyle behaviors during the same period. Multivariate linear regression with robust variance and accounting for within-person repeated measures were used to evaluate the association. Results across the three cohorts were pooled by an inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: Participants gained an average of 1.45 kg (5th to 95th percentile: -1.87 to 5.46) within each 4-year period. After controlling for age, baseline body mass index and changes in other lifestyle behaviors (diet, smoking habits, exercise, alcohol, sleep duration, TV watching), each 1 cup per day increment of water intake was inversely associated with weight gain within each 4-year period (-0.13 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.17 to -0.08). The associations for other beverages were: sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) (0.36 kg; 95% CI: 0.24-0.48), fruit juice (0.22 kg; 95% CI: 0.15-0.28), coffee (-0.14 kg; 95% CI: -0.19 to -0.09), tea (-0.03 kg; 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.01), diet beverages (-0.10 kg; 95% CI: -0.14 to -0.06), low-fat milk (0.02 kg; 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.09) and whole milk (0.02 kg; 95% CI: -0.06 to 0.10). We estimated that replacement of 1 serving per day of SSBs by 1 cup per day of water was associated with 0.49 kg (95% CI: 0.32-0.65) less weight gain over each 4-year period, and the replacement estimate of fruit juices by water was 0.35 kg (95% CI: 0.23-0.46). Substitution of SSBs or fruit juices by other beverages (coffee, tea, diet beverages, low-fat and whole milk) were all significantly and inversely associated with weight gain.
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that increasing water intake in place of SSBs or fruit juices is associated with lower long-term weight gain.

AB We examined the effects of exercise training on the levels of lipid droplet (LD)-associated and mitochondria-related proteins in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats. Furthermore, we assessed putative factors induced by exercise to activate lipolysis in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. DIO Wistar male rats (age 20 wk) were divided into sedentary control (SED, n = 7) and exercise training (EX, n = 7) groups. EX animals were subjected to treadmill running (25 m/min, 1 h/day, 5 days/wk) for 6 wk. Epididymal fat was dissected and used for protein analyses. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with media containing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sodium-lactate, caffeine, AICAR, or SNAP (NO donor) for 6 h, or 1 mM H2O2 for 15 min, followed by incubation with normal media for up to 24 h total. Protein expression levels and lipolytic activities were biochemically assayed. Epididymal fat significantly decreased in EX animals compared with SED animals. Levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COx), perilipin, hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) proteins in epididymal fat pads of EX animals were significantly increased compared with those in SED animals. In 3T3-L1 cells, glycerol or fatty acid release was significantly increased by all treatments. Lactate or SNAP significantly increased PGC-1 alpha expression, and H2O2 significantly increased COx protein levels compared with controls. Expression of perilipin, HSL, ATGL, or comparative gene identification (CGI)-58 was significantly increased by all treatments. By increasing lipolytic activity in adipocytes, the exercise-inducible factors are attractive therapeutic effectors against LD-associated metabolic diseases.

AB The effects of catechin-enriched green tea on Chinese adults with a high proportion of abdominal visceral fat were evaluated. Subjects (118) were randomly assigned to consume daily a beverage containing 609.3 mg catechins and 68.7 mg caffeine or a control beverage for 12 weeks. Abdominal fat area, body weight and composition were measured at week 0, week 8, and week 12. One hundred and four subjects completed the trial. Average visceral fat area, body weight, and body fat were reduced significantly by catechin-enriched green tea treatment but these effects were not seen in the control group with per-protocol sets analysis. The decrease at week 12 in the visceral fat area in the catechin group was greater than that in the control group (P = 0.04). Thus, consumption of the catechin-enriched green tea beverage for 12 weeks induced visceral fat loss in Chinese adults with a high proportion of abdominal visceral fat. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The discovery of a form of low-grade systemic inflammation (called 'metaflammation'), and the close evolutionary link between the immune and metabolic systems, poses questions about the supposed antigens (inducers) of such an immune reaction. Initially, this was thought to be mediated through obesity. However, we have identified a number of lifestyle or environmentally related inducers that may cause metaflammation, even in the absence of obesity. In this paper, the third of a series linking obesity with broad environmental and evolutionary factors, we identify nutritional stimuli with evidence of an involvement in metaflammation. From this we propose that components of certain foods and beverages with which humans have not evolved, are more often the inducers of an inflammatory effect in the body than those with which humans have become more familiar, and to which a neutral, or anti-inflammatory response may be expected to have developed. The implications of such a finding are considered in relation to broader aspects of the environment, economic growth, policy change and current global financial issues.

AB To develop a therapeutic agent for obesity-related metabolic disorders, a mixture of dietary components was prepared, including grape extract, green tea extract and L-carnitine (RGTC), and its effects on obesity, hyperlipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease examined. The RGTC dramatically inhibited the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced increase in body weight and fat in C57BL/6 mice, whereas food consumption was not affected by RGTC treatment. The RGTC also concentration-dependently suppressed the HFD-induced increase in plasma lipids, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. In addition, increases in liver weight and liver steatosis were returned to normal by RGTC treatment in HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice. The plasma levels of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase were also significantly down-regulated by RGTC treatment. These results suggest that RGTC suppressed HFD-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, suggesting that RGTC supplementation might be a promising adjuvant therapy for the treatment of these metabolic disorders.

AB Background: Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption has been linked with poor diet quality, weight gain, and increased risk for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have been hampered by inconsistent definitions and a failure to capture all types of SSBs.
   Purpose: To comprehensively examine total SSB consumption in the U.S. using an all-encompassing definition that includes beverages calorically sweetened after purchase in addition to presweetened beverages.
   Methods: Data from the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N=17,078) were analyzed in September 2012 and used to estimate calories (kilocalories) of added sugars from SSBs and to identify top sources of SSBs.
   Results: On average, Americans aged >= 2 years consumed 171 kcal (8% of total kcal) per day from added sugars in SSBs; the top sources were soda, fruit drinks, tea, coffee, energy/sports drinks, and flavored milks. Male adolescents (aged 12-19 years) had the highest mean intakes (293 kcal/day; 12% of total kcal).
   Conclusions: Americans consume more calories from added sugars in beverages than previously reported. The methodology presented in this paper allows for more-comprehensive estimates than those previously used regarding the extent to which SSBs provide calories from added sugars.

AB Numerous studies indicate that an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) significantly affects white adipose tissue biology and leads to an inflammatory profile and insulin resistance, which could contribute to obesity-associated diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Mitochondria play a key role in adipose tissue energy metabolism and constitute the main source of cellular ROS such as H2O2. Polyphenols constitute the most abundant antioxidants provided by the human diet. Indeed, they are widely distributed in fruits, vegetables and some plant-derived beverages such as coffee and tea. Thus, the biological effects of dietary polyphenols that may increase the antioxidant capacity of the body against obesity-induced oxidative stress are of high interest. Here, we studied the capacity of polyphenols to modulate the impact of oxidative stress on the mitochondria of preadipocytes, which are important cells governing the adipose tissue development for energy homeostasis. Whereas H2O2 treatment induces a proliferation arrest associated with an increase in mitochondrial content in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, preconditioning with some major dietary polyphenols totally or partially protects the cells against oxidative stress consequences.

AB Objective: To assess and compare the number and type of outdoor food advertisements at public transit stops within suburbs of varying levels of socioeconomic disadvantage.
   Method: An observational audit tool was developed and implemented to assess the number and type of food advertisements at public transit stops within Melbourne, Victoria. A total of 20 Melbourne neighbourhoods (suburbs) from across the least and the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas were selected. All public transit stops, including train stations and bus and tram stops with a shelter were audited.
   Results: A similar proportion of transit stops in the least and most-disadvantaged suburbs displayed food advertisements (total n= 203). However, some differences in the type of advertisements across suburbs were noted with advertisements for fast food restaurants, flavoured milk and fruit juice more common in the most-disadvantaged neighbourhoods (all p< 0.05) and advertisements for diet soft drink, tea, coffee and convenience stores more common in the least-disadvantaged neighbourhoods (all p< 0.05).
   Conclusion: This exploration of outdoor food advertising at Melbourne transit stops found 30% displayed food advertisements, with those in more disadvantaged suburbs more frequently promoting chain-brand fast food and less frequently promoting diet varieties of soft drinks. These findings may help raise awareness of unhealthy environmental exposures.

AB Polyphenols, retained in black tea wastes following the commercial production of tea beverages, represent an underutilized resource. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential use of hot-compressed water (HCW) for the extraction of pancreatic lipase-inhibiting polyphenols from black tea residues. Black tea residues were treated with HCW at 10 degrees C intervals, from 100 to 200 degrees C. The resulting extracts were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and assayed to determine their inhibitory effect on pancreatic lipase activity in vitro. Four theaflavins (TF), 5 catechins, 2 quercetin glycosides, quinic acid, gallic acid, and caffeine were identified. The total polyphenol content of extracts increased with increasing temperature but lipase inhibitors (TF, theaflavin 3-O-gallate, theaflavin 3'-O-gallate, theaflavin 3,3'-O-gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, and epicatechin gallate) decreased over 150 degrees C. All extracts inhibited pancreatic lipase but extracts obtained at 100 to 140 degrees C showed the greatest lipase inhibition (IC(50)s of 0.9 to 1.3 mu g/mL), consistent with the optimal extraction of TFs and catechins except catechin by HCW between 130 and 150 degrees C. HCW can be used to extract pancreatic lipase-inhibiting polyphenols from black tea waste. These extracts have potential uses, as dietary supplements and medications, for the prevention and treatment of obesity.

AB Objective: To assess a county population's exposure to different types of food sources reported to affect both diet quality and obesity rates.
   Design: Food permit records obtained from the local health department served to establish the full census of food stores and restaurants. Employing prior categorization schemes which classified the relative healthfulness of food sources based on establishment type (i.e. supermarkets v. convenience stores, or full-service v. fast-food restaurants), food establishments were assigned to the healthy, unhealthy or undetermined groups.
   Setting: King County, WA, USA.
   Subjects: Full census of food sources.
   Results: According to all categorization schemes, most food establishments in King County fell into the unhealthy and undetermined groups. Use of the food permit data showed that large stores, which included supermarkets as healthy food establishments, contained a sizeable number of bakery/delis, fish/meat, ethnic and standard quick-service restaurants and coffee shops, all food sources that, when housed in a separate venue or owned by a different business establishment, were classified as either unhealthy or of undetermined value to health.
   Conclusions: To fully assess the potential health effects of exposure to the extant food environment, future research would need to establish the health value of foods in many such common establishments as individually owned grocery stores and ethnic food stores and restaurants. Within-venue exposure to foods should also be investigated.

AB Objective: Resting energy expenditure (EE) is a major contributor to the total EE and thus plays an important role in body weight regulation. Adaptive thermogenesis is a major component of EE in rodents, but little is known on the effects of exposure of humans to mild and sustainable reduction in environmental temperature.
   Design: To characterize the dynamic changes in continuously measured resting EE, substrate utilization, and hormonal axes simultaneously in response to mild reduction in environmental temperature, we performed a cross-over intervention.
   Methods: Twenty-five volunteers underwent two 12-h recordings of EE in whole room indirect calorimeters at 24 and 19 degrees C with simultaneous measurement of spontaneous movements and hormonal axes.
   Results: Exposure to 19 degrees C resulted in an increase in plasma and urine norepinephrine levels (P < 0.0001), and a 5.96% (P < 0.001) increase in EE without significant changes in spontaneous physical activity. Exposure to the lower temperature resulted in a significant increase in free fatty acid levels (P < 0.01), fasting insulin levels (P < 0.05), and a marginal decrease in postprandial glucose levels. A small but significant (P < 0.002) increase in serum free thyroxine and urinary free cortisol (P < 0.05) was observed at 19 degrees C.
   Conclusions: Our observations indicate that exposure to 19 degrees C, a mild and tolerable cold temperature, results in a predictable increase in EE driven by a sustained rise in catecholamine and the activation of counter-regulatory mechanisms.

We hypothesized that a consumption of a substantial breakfast compared with skipping or small breakfasts would be associated with lower BMI. Three independent, cross-sectional, screening surveys were conducted by Sydney Adventist Hospital in 1976, 1986, and 2005 in the surrounding community. The archived survey forms of 384 men and 338 women in 1976, 244 men and 229 women in 1986, and 270 men and 62 women in 2005 were randomly selected. Body mass index was determined from height and weight measured by hospital staff. The reported amount consumed at breakfast was one of several eating habits that predicted BMI for men but not women. It explained 5% to 6% of the variance in male BMI in all 3 years examined. As the reported breakfast amount increased, men's BMI decreased. Lifestyle confounders including vegetarianism and physical activity did not affect this relationship. However, the consumption of breakfast was significantly positively associated with consumption of cereals, bread, fruit, and spreads, while coffee consumption was significantly associated with smaller breakfasts or breakfast skipping. The consumption of relatively large breakfasts may influence BMI in men, and its promotion may help reduce the prevalence of obesity in Australia and elsewhere. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Children in food-insecure households are more likely to experience poorer health function and worse academic achievement. To investigate the relation between economic environmental factors and food insecurity among children, we examined the relation between general and specific food prices (fast food, fruits and vegetables, beverages) and risk of low (LFS) and very low food security (VLFS) status among low-income American households with children. Using information for 27,900 child-year observations from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998 1999 linked with food prices obtained from the Cost of Living Data of the Council for Community and Economic Research, formerly known as the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers' Association, fixed effects models were estimated within stratified income groups. Higher overall food prices were associated with increased risk of LFS and VLFS (coefficient = 0.617; P < 0.05). Higher fast food and fruit and vegetable prices also contributed to higher risk of food insecurity (coefficient = 0.632, P < 0.01 for fast food; coefficient = 0.879, P < 0.01 for fruits and vegetables). However, increasing beverage prices, including the prices of soft drinks, orange juice, and coffee, had a protective effect on food security status, even when controlling for general food prices. Thus, although food price changes were strongly related to food security status among low-income American households with children, the effects were not uniform across types of food. These relations should be accounted for when implementing policies that change specific food prices.

AB Green tea is made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis L plant, which is rich in polyphenol catechins and caffeine. There is increasing interest in the potential role of green tea extract (GTE) in fat metabolism and its influence on health and exercise performance. A number of studies have observed positive effects of GTE on fat metabolism at rest and during exercise, following both shorter and longer term intake. However, overall, the literature is inconclusive. The fact that not all studies observed effects may be related to differences in study designs, GTE bioavailability, and variation of the measurement (fat oxidation). In addition, the precise mechanisms of GTE in the human body that increase fat oxidation are unclear. The often-cited in vitro catechol-O-methyltransferase mechanism is used to explain the changes in substrate metabolism with little in vivo evidence to support it. Also, changes in expression of fat metabolism genes with longer term GTE intake have been implicated at rest and with exercise training, including the upregulation of fat metabolism enzyme gene expression in the skeletal muscle and downregulation of adipogenic genes in the liver. The exact molecular signaling that activates changes to fat metabolism gene expression is unclear but may be driven by PPAR-gamma coactivator 1-alpha and PPARs. However, to date, evidence from human studies to support these adaptations is lacking. Clearly, more studies have to be performed to elucidate the effects of GTE on fat metabolism as well as improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Adv. Nutr. 4: 129-140, 2013.

   ADIPOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION
AB Greater understanding about the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and potential causes suggests that plant polyphenols might be useful as a treatment. Dietary excess energy can be stored in adipocytes, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and adipose-related hormones that cause vascular injury. Plant polyphenols, organic compounds found in numerous plant species and their fruits, are being actively studied as potential treatments for components of the metabolic syndrome. Individual polyphenols that have been examined include resveratrol, quercetin, epigallocathechin-3-gallate, and curcumin. Resveratrol lowers weight, blood pressure, glucose, and insulin resistance in rodents, and a human trial is currently underway. Quercetin decreases lipid and glucose levels in obese rats, and in a human investigation of subjects with the metabolic syndrome has lowered blood pressure without significant alteration of lipids. Epigallocathechin-3-gallate-induced weight loss has attenuated glucose levels and insulin resistance in rodents and improved hemoglobin A(1c) and lipid in human studies. Plant extracts also can be used. Grape seed and chokeberry extracts have decreased blood pressure and lipid levels in small human trials. Other human investigations have shown the beneficial effects of cocoa, coffee, carob, and Momordica charantia. Thus far, most studies have involved a small number of subjects and have been of short duration. Future studies should be designed to account for a disease process in which the pathogenic factors may take place for years before disease manifestations take place, the possibly limited bioavailability of polyphenols, and the potential need to provide combinations or modifications of polyphenols.

AB Insulin and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) are reported to regulate obesity and fat accumulation, respectively. This study investigated the pathways involved in EGCG modulation of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 and C3H10T1/2 adipocytes. EGCG inhibited insulin stimulation of adipocyte glucose uptake in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The concentration of EGCG that decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 50-60% was approximately 5-10 mu M for a period of 2h. At 10 mu M, EGCG and gallic acid were more effective than (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, and (-)-epicatechin 3-gallate. We identified the EGCG receptor [also known as the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR)] in fat cells and extended the findings for this study to clarify whether EGCG-induced changes in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes could be mediated through the 67LR. Pretreatment of adipocytes with a 67LR antibody, but not normal rabbit immunoglobulin, prevented the effects of EGCG on insulin-increased glucose uptake. This suggests that the 67LR mediates the effect of EGCG on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. Moreover, pretreatment with an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, such as compound C, but not with a glutathione (GSH) activator, such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), blocked the antiinsulin effect of EGCG on adipocyte glucose uptake. These data suggest that EGCG exerts its anti-insulin action on adipocyte glucose uptake via the AMPK, but not the GSH, pathway. The results of this study possibly support that EGCG mediates fat content.

AB The present study investigated taste preferences in a sample of 1705 children aged 6 to 9 years from survey centres in Italy, Estonia, Cyprus, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and aimed to identify factors correlated with taste preference. Children's preferences for varying levels of sucrose (sweet) in apple juice and fat, sodium chloride (salt) and monosodium glutamate (umami) in crackers were assessed using paired-comparison tests. Socio-demographics (age, sex, parental education), early feeding practises (breastfeeding, introduction of fruits), parenting behaviour (TV viewing, using food as a reward) and taste threshold sensitivity for sucrose (sweet), sodium chloride (salt), caffeine (bitter) and monosodium glutamate (umami) were investigated as possible correlates of taste preferences. Parents reported on socio-demographics, early feeding and parenting behaviour. Taste thresholds were determined via a paired-comparison staircase method. Country of residence was the strongest factor related to preferences for all four tastes. Taste preferences also differed by age. Preference for sugar and salt increased between 6 and 9 years of age while preference for monosodium glutamate decreased. The age differences remained significant even after adjustment for sex, country of residence, parental education and early feeding habits. Sex, parental education, early feeding habits, TV viewing, using food as a reward and taste thresholds were not consistently related to taste preferences among the survey centres. In summary, the results highlight the importance of culture and age in taste preferences in children younger than 10 years of age. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To examine the association of dietary habits with high total antioxidant capacity (TAC) with frailty among elderly Japanese women.
   Cross-sectional multicenter study.
   Thirty-five of 47 prefectures in Japan.
   2121 grandmothers or acquaintances of dietetic students aged 65 and older.
   Dietary TAC and food intakes were calculated using a validated brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire. The TAC value of each food was assigned using four different assays, ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP). Frailty was defined as the presence three or more of the following four components: slowness and weakness (two points), exhaustion, low physical activity, and unintentional weight loss.
   The number of subjects with frailty was 486 (23%). Multivariate adjusted ORs (95% CI) for frailty in the highest compared to the lowest quintile were 0.35 (0.24, 0.53) for FRAP, 0.35 (0.23, 0.52) for ORAC, 0.40 (0.27, 0.60) for TEAC, and 0.41 (0.28, 0.62) for TRAP. The intakes of green tea, coffee, vegetables, and fruits which contribute to dietary TAC were also associated with lower odds of frailty (the range of multivariate adjusted OR: 0.47 for vegetables to 0.77 for green tea), although the odds ratios were less marked than those of dietary TAC.
   Dietary habits with high TAC showed a stronger inverse association with frailty in elderly Japanese women than the individual foods examined.

AB Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a widely consumed beverage, and laboratory and some intervention studies have indicated the potential health benefits of hot tea. The present study examines the association between tea consumption (evaluating hot and iced tea independently) and markers for metabolic syndrome adults in a sample of 6,472 who participated in the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination surveys.
   Tea consumption was evaluated using food frequency questionnaires and 24-h dietary recalls. Seventy percent of the sample reported any consumption of iced tea and 16 % were daily consumers, whereas approximately 56 % of this sample reported hot tea consumption and 9 % were daily consumers.
   Hot tea consumption was inversely associated with obesity: tea consumers had lower mean waist circumference and lower BMI (25 vs. 28 kg/m(2) in men; 26 vs. 29 kg/m(2) in women; both P < 0.01) than non-consumers after controlling for age, physical activity, total energy intake, and other confounders. For iced tea consumption, the association was reversed: increased iced tea consumption was associated with higher BMI, greater waist circumference, and greater subcutaneous skinfold thickness after controlling for age, physical activity, energy intake, sugar intake, and other confounders. Hot tea consumption was associated with beneficial biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk and inflammation (increased high-density lipoprotein-associated cholesterol and decreased C-reactive protein in both sexes, and reduced triglycerides in women), whereas the association with iced tea consumption was again reversed.
   These cross-sectional results support growing laboratory data, which demonstrate the negative association of hot tea intake with markers of MetS.

AB A previous finding that soft drink intake is associated with increased serum triglycerides and decreased highdensity-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, both components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), raises the question of whether other aspects of an unhealthy diet might be associated with MetS. Main MetS requirements are central obesity and 2 of the following: increased triglycerides, low HDL, increased systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and elevated fasting blood glucose. Of the 18 770 participants in the Oslo Health Study, there were 13 170 respondents (5997 men and 7173 women) with data on MetS factors (except fasting glucose) and on the components used to determine the Dietary Index score (calculated as the intake estimate of soft drinks divided by the sum of intake estimates of fruits and vegetables). MetSRisk was calculated as the sum of arbitrarily weighted factors positively associated with MetS divided by HDL cholesterol. Using regression analyses, the association of the Dietary Index with MetSRisk, with the number of MetS requirements present, and with the complete MetS was studied. In young, middle-aged, and senior men and women, there was, in general, a positive association (p < 0.001) between the Dietary Index and the MetS estimates, which persisted in regression models adjusted for sex, age, time since the last meal, intake of cheese, intake of fatty fish, intake of coffee, intake of alcohol, smoking, physical activity, education, and birthplace. Thus, an index reflecting a high intake of soft drinks and a low intake of fruit and vegetables was positively and independently associated with aspects of MetS.

AB Tea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae) and tea polyphenols have been studied for the prevention of chronic diseases, including obesity. Obesity currently affects >20% of adults in the United States and is a risk factor for chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Given this increasing public health concern, the use of dietary agents for the prevention of obesity would be of tremendous benefit. Whereas many laboratory studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of green or black tea for the prevention of obesity, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The results of human intervention studies are mixed and the role of caffeine has not been clearly established. Finally, there is emerging evidence that high doses of tea polyphenols may have adverse side effects. Given that the results of scientific studies on dietary components, including tea polyphenols, are often translated into dietary supplements, understanding the potential toxicities of the tea polyphenols is critical to understanding their potential usefulness in preventing obesity. In this review, we will critically evaluate the evidence for the prevention of obesity by tea, discuss the relevance of proposed mechanisms in light of tea polyphenol bioavailability, and review the reports concerning the toxic effects of high doses of tea polyphenols and the implication that this has for the potential use of tea for the prevention of obesity. We hope that this review will expose areas for further study and encourage research on this important public health issue. J. Nutr. 140: 446-453,2010.

AB Given the increased concern about the impact of TV food advertisements (ads) on individual food choices, we provide important evidence on TV food ad exposure between 2004 and 2009 in South Korea. We used monthly targeted ratings data by age group as the number of ads seen daily from Korean Nielsen Media Research. We generated six food groups: beverages (milk, soda, fruit drinks, sports/energy drinks, water, coffee/tea products, and other); snacks/sweets (cookies/chips, candy, and chewing gum); fast food (Domino's pizza, Lotteria, McDonald's, Mr. Pizza, Pizza Hut, local chicken and pizza franchises, and other); instant noodle; full-service restaurants; and other. From 2004 to 2009, overall exposure to television food ads fell by 19.0% (from 6.8 to 5.5 ads daily), although exposure to full-service restaurant ads increased over that time period by 45.7%. While fast-food ad exposure fell overall, exposure to ads for local fried chicken franchises nearly doubled, making them the most commonly seen fast-food ads by 2009. Fast-food and instant noodle ads made up larger proportions of total ad exposure in 2009 than in 2004 in all age groups, with the largest increase among adolescents. Beverage ads continue to be the most prevalent food ads seen in South Korea. Differential trends found in exposure across and within food product categories and differences by age groups highlight the need for continued monitoring to help inform the regulatory policy debate on food advertising, particularly with regards to ads directed at children and adolescents.

AB Objective: To evaluate the association between the consumption of unhealthy foods in children under one year and the education level of the mothers, data obtained from participants of the II Survey on the prevalence of breastfeeding in the Brazilian capitals and the Federal District in 2008 was analyzed.
   Methods: During the second stage of the campaign for multi-vaccination, a questionnaire on food consumption in the last 24 hours was given to mothers or guardians of children under one year old. We analyzed the consumption of unhealthy foods according to age group, maternal education, region of residence and breastfeeding status. The state capitals and the Federal District were grouped according to the five macro-regions of the country (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and West). Processed juice, soda, coffee, cookies/salted snacks and sugar and/or honey were defined as unhealthy foods. Prevalence ratios (RP) for the association between the consumption of unhealthy foods and maternal education were estimated using Poisson regression models. Results: The study included 34,366 children. The consumption of sweet foods started early and was predominant until the age of six months; after this age, the consumption of biscuits and/or snacks became more prevalent. The consumption of these foods also differs in relation to the macro-region of residence.
   Consumption of unhealthy foods was higher among mothers with lower education levels. Conclusions: The consumption of unhealthy foods by Brazilian children under one year old was high, indicating a need for developing effective strategies to combat the consumption of unhealthy foods in Brazilian children as a way of preventing obesity and other future disorders.

AB Objective: We previously reported that the frequency of cheese intake (FCI) was negatively associated with serum triglycerides and positively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), both components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). We therefore wanted to study whether FCI is associated with MetS.
   Methods: The Oslo Health Study (18,770 subjects), obtained data from 7815 men and 9685 women on cheese intake and risk factors for MetS, except for fasting glucose. MetS requires central obesity and at least 2 of the following: increased triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, increased systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and elevated fasting blood glucose. We calculated the index SumRisk, providing the number of MetS factors present, and MetSRisk to reflect the combined levels of many MetS factors. The association between FCI and MetSRisk (SumRisk) was studied using regression analyses.
   Results: In young (30 years), middle-aged (40 and 45 years), seniors (59-60), and old (75-76 years) subjects, there was an inverse association between FCI and MetSRisk (p <= 0.005, except in old men). Using regression, we found a consistent negative association (p < 0.001) between FCI and MetSRisk, SumRisk, single MetS components, and the complete MetS, prevailing after controlling for sex, age, time since last meal, intake of fruit/berries, fruit juice, fatty fish, coffee, alcohol, smoking, leisure time physical activity, years at school, and birthplace. FCI was also negatively associated with body mass index (p < 0.02), except in old women.
   Conclusion: Cheese intake can be negatively and independently associated with (1) an index including the level of many risk factors for MetS, (2) the number of MetS requirements present, (3) single MetS components, and (4) the complete MetS.

AB The rapid weight loss that occurs in obese patients submitted to Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) as well as the changes in dietary pattern and the intestinal malabsorption result in changes in bone mineral density (BMD). The objective of the present study was to assess the changes in BMD after the weight loss induced by RYGB using ultrasound of the phalanges and compare the results with those obtained by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We conducted a 1-yr prospective longitudinal study on women with grade III obesity submitted to RYGB. Anthropometric (weight, height, body mass index, and abdominal circumference) and body composition measurements by electrical bioimpedance, assessment of food consumption by 24-h recall, biochemical evaluation, and assessment of BMD by ultrasonography of the phalanges and DXA (BMD values are from the 33% radius site) were performed during the preoperative period and 3, 6, and 12 mo after surgery. The mixed-effects linear regression model was used to analyze the effect of postoperative time on the variable of interest, and the kappa coefficient (p < 0.05) was used to compare the concordance of the methods used for BMD evaluation. Twenty-nine patients were included in the study. During the 1-yr follow-up, a reduction of 39 +/- 8 kg (71 +/- 15% of excess weight) and -29 +/- 7 kg of fat mass was observed. Calcium and zinc concentrations were reduced after 12 mo. No difference in caffeine, calcium, or sodium consumption was observed between the preoperative and postoperative periods. Analysis of BMD by ultrasonography of the phalanges 1 yr after surgery showed increased values of amplitude-dependent speed of sound (2064.6 +/- 59.4 vs 2154.7 +/- 63 m/s; p < 0.001) and ultrasound bone profile index (0.73 +/- 0.13 vs 0.76 +/- 0.14; p < 0.001). Analysis of BMD by DXA showed a reduction of BMD values (0.6 +/- 0.04 vs 0.57 +/- 0.05 g/cm(3); p < 0.001) in the sixth month and maintenance of the values from the sixth to the 12th month. At the end of the study, there was no concordance between the methods for BMD analysis. This study showed improvement in bone quality and quantity assessed by ultrasonography. However, the MCA results showed a reduction in BMD after 12 mo of RYGB. Thus, the BMD measurement methods were discordant.

AB Green tea is purported to promote weight loss. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and the thermic effect of feeding (TEF) are significant components of total daily energy expenditure and are partially determined by the sympathetic nervous system via catecholamine-mediated stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG: the most bioactive catechin in green tea) inhibits catechol-O-methyltransferase, an enzyme contributing to the degradation of catecholamines. Accordingly, we hypothesized that short-term consumption of a commercially available EGCG supplement (Teavigo) augments RMR and TEF. On two separate occasions, seven placebo or seven EGCG capsules (135 mg/capsule) were administered to 16 adults (9 males, 7 females, age 25 +/- 2 years, BMI 24.6 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2) (mean +/- s.e.)). Capsules (three/day) were consumed over 48 h; the final capsule was consumed 2 h prior to visiting the laboratory. Energy expenditure (ventilated hood technique) was determined at rest and for 5 h following ingestion of a liquid meal (caloric content: 40% RMR). Contrary to our hypothesis, RMR was not greater (P = 0.10) following consumption of EGCG (6,740 +/- 373 kJ/day) compared with placebo (6,971 +/- 352). Similarly, the area under the TEF response curve (Delta energy expenditure) was also unaffected by EGCG (246,808 +/- 23,748 vs. 243,270 +/- 22,177 kJ; P = 0.88). EGCG had no effect on respiratory exchange ratio at rest (P = 0.29) or throughout the TEF measurement (P = 0.56). In summary, together RMR and TEF may account for up to 85% of total daily energy expenditure; we report that short-term consumption of a commercially available EGCG supplement did not increase RMR or TEF.

AB P>Objectives
   Little is known regarding the distribution and the determinants of leptin and adiponectin levels in the general population.
   Design
   Cross-sectional study.
   Patients
   Women (3004) and men (2552) aged 35-74 living in Lausanne, Switzerland.
   Measurements
   Plasma levels of leptin and adiponectin (ELISA measurement).
   Results
   Women had higher leptin and adiponectin levels than men. In both genders, leptin and adiponectin levels increased with age. After adjusting for fat mass, leptin levels were significantly and negatively associated with age in women: 18 center dot 1 +/- 0 center dot 3, 17 center dot 1 +/- 0 center dot 3, 16 center dot 7 +/- 0 center dot 3 and 15 center dot 5 +/- 0 center dot 4 ng/ml (adjusted mean +/- SE) for age groups [35-44], [45-54], [55-64] and [65-75], respectively, P < 0 center dot 001. A similar but nonsignificant trend was also found in men. Conversely, the age-related increase of adiponectin was unrelated to body fat in both genders. Post-menopausal women had higher leptin and adiponectin levels than premenopausal women, independently of hormone replacement therapy. Although body fat mass was associated with leptin and adiponectin, the associations were stronger with body mass index (BMI), waist and hip in both genders. Finally, after adjusting for age and anthropometry, no relationships were found between leptin or adiponectin levels with alcohol, caffeine consumption and physical activity, whereas smoking and diabetes decreased leptin and adiponectin levels in women only.
   Conclusions
   The age-related increase in leptin levels is attributable to changes in fat mass in women and probably also in men. Leptin and adiponectin levels are more related to BMI than to body fat mass. The effects of smoking and diabetes appear to be gender-specific.

AB Background: This study assesses the accuracy of energy intake (El) reporting and its relation to anthropometric characteristics and sociodemographic factors. In addition, we attempt to identify foods for which under- or over-reporting is more prevalent.
   Methods: El was assessed for 187 women using a semi-quantitative 168-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured with an indirect calorimeter. We calculated the El/RMR ratio to assess the accuracy of El reporting. This study defined under-reporters as those with an El/RMR of <= 1.34 and over-reporters as those with an El/RMR of >= 2.4. We measured anthropometric characteristics and collected sociodemographic information. The chi-square test, ANOVA and multiple linear regressions were used for statistical analyses.
   Results: Among participants, the under-reporting rate was 35.5% and the over-reporting rate was 7.5%. The El/RMR ratio was significantly higher for younger women compared to older women (P < 0.04). Under-reporters had higher weight, waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI) and resting metabolism compared to accurate reporters (P < 0.05). Resting metabolism was significantly lower among over-reporters than accurate reporters. After adjusting for energy, the consumption of fish, high-fat dairy products, hydrogenated oil, sweets and coffee was lower, whereas consumption of unsaturated oils, tea, salt and yellow vegetables was higher among under-reporters compared to accurate reporters.
   Conclusion: Under-reporting of El is more frequent than over-reporting among Iranian women. Among various factors that may affect the accuracy of El reporting, age and anthropometric characteristics might have a significant effect.

AB The aim of this study was to provide descriptive information on meal and snack patterns and to investigate snacks in relation to energy intake and food choice according to the meal patterns of employed people in Korea. 683 employed people (292 males, 391 females) were interviewed to collect one day dietary data by using 24-h dietary recall. A recorded day was divided into 3 meal and 3 snack periods by the respondent's criteria and the time of consumption. To analyze the eating pattern participants were divided as the more frequent snack eaters (MFSE) and the less frequent snack eaters (LFSE). They were also categorized into 6 groups according to the frequency of all eating occasions. The common meal pattern in nearly half of the subjects (47.6%) was composed of three meals plus one or two snacks per day. A trend of an increasing the number of snacks in between main meals emerges, although the conventional meal pattern is still retained in most employed Korean adults. Women, aged 30-39, and urban residents, had a higher number of being MFSE than LFSE. Increasing eating occasions was associated with higher energy, protein, and carbohydrate intakes, with the exception of fat intakes. 16.8% of the total daily energy intake came from snack consumption, while the 3 main meals contributed 83.2%. Energy and macronutrient intakes from snacks in the MFSE were significantly higher than the LFSE. Instant coffee was the most popular snack in the morning and afternoon, whereas heavy snacks and alcohol were more frequently consumed by both of the meal skipper groups (<= 2M+2,3S and <= 2M+0,1S) in the evening. In conclusion, meal pattern is changing to reflect an increase of more snacks between the three main meals. Meal and snack patterns may be markers for the energy and macronutrient intakes of employed people in Korea.

AB Supplementation with green tea extract (GTE) in animals has been reported to induce numerous metabolic adaptations including increased fat oxidation during exercise and improved performance. However, data regarding the metabolic and physiological effects of GTE during exercise in humans are limited and equivocal. Purpose: To examine the effects of short-term GTE treatment on resting energy expenditure (REE), whole-body substrate utilization during exercise and time trial performance. Methods: Fifteen active men (24 +/- 3 y; VO(2)peak = 48 +/- 7 ml.kg.min(-1); BMI = 26 +/- 3 kg.m(2(-1))) ingested GTE (3x per day = 1,000 mg/d) or placebo (PLA) for 2 day in a double-blind, crossover design (each separated by a 1 week wash-out period). REE was assessed in the fasted state. Subjects then ingested a standardized breakfast (similar to 5.0 kcal.kg(-1)) and 90 min later performed a 60 min cycling bout at an intensity corresponding to individual maximal fat oxidation (44 +/- 11% VO(2)peak), followed by a 250 kJ TT. Results: REE, whole-body oxygen consumption (VO2) and substrate oxidation rates during steady-state exercise were not different between treatments. However, mean heart rate (HR) was lower in GTE vs. PLA (115 +/- 16 vs. 118 +/- 17 beats.min(-1); main effect, p = .049). Mixed venous blood [glycerol] was higher during rest and exercise after GTE vs. PLA (p = .006, main effect for treatment) but glucose, insulin and free-fatty acids were not different. Subsequent time trial performance was not different between treatments (GTE = 25:38 +/- 5:32 vs. PLA = 26:08 +/- 8:13 min; p = .75). Conclusion: GTE had minimal effects on whole-body substrate metabolism but significantly increased plasma glycerol and lowered heart rate during steady-state exercise, suggesting a potential increase in lipolysis and a cardiovascular effect that warrants further investigation.

AB All-population and area-based investigations of diet in central obesity are scarce. We used cross-sectional data from 50 339 individuals who responded to the HUNT3 survey of 2006-2008, which recruited from all county-residing adults 20 years and older, to investigate whether those with central obesity eat and drink differently than others. Answers to dietary questions were recoded and analyzed with multiple linear regression, using waist/hip ratio (WHR), age, and sex as explanatory variables. Frequencies of consumption or amounts of food, beverages, and meals were compared among WHR quartiles. Central obesity was present in the quartile with the highest WHR, WHR4(WHR >= 0.917 for women and 0.981 for men) but not in the quartile with the lowest WHR, WHR1 (WHR<0.817 for women and 0.895 for men). Dietary variables differed markedly by age and sex. After adjustment for these factors and for multiple testing, we found significant differences between WHR4 and WHR1 for 19 of 30 dietary variables. Central obesity was associated with a lower intake of any bread, and of whole-grain bread in particular. Intake of fruits and berries, vegetables, and pasta and rice was less, and intake of sausages and hamburgers and boiled potatoes was more frequent. Intake of alcohol, tea, and fruit juice was lower in those with central obesity, whereas intake of sugar-free soft drinks and coffee was higher. The frequency of breakfast and lunch was lower and of nightly meals was higher in those with central obesity. In conclusion, in this large area-based population, central obesity was associated with differences in dietary habits, some of which (such as decreased consumption of whole-grain bread and increased intake of sugar-free drinks) are of possible clinical significance.

AB Background: Food environment studies have focused on ethnic and income disparities in food access. Few studies have investigated distance travelled for food and did not aim to inform the geographic scales at which to study the relationship between food environments and obesity. Further, studies have not considered neighborhood design as a predictor of food purchasing behavior.
   Methods: Atlanta residents (N = 4800) who completed a travel diary and reported purchasing or consuming food at one of five food locations were included in the analyses. A total of 11,995 food-related trips were reported. Using mixed modeling to adjust for clustering of trips by participants and households, person-level variables (e.g. demographics), neighborhood-level urban form measures, created in GIS, and trip characteristics (e.g. time of day, origin and destination) were investigated as correlates of distance travelled for food and frequency of grocery store and fast food outlet trips.
   Results: Mean travel distance for food ranged from 4.5 miles for coffee shops to 6.3 miles for superstores. Type of store, urban form, type of tour, day of the week and ethnicity were all significantly related to distance travelled for food. Origin and destination environment, type of tour, day of week, age, gender, income, ethnicity, vehicle access and obesity status were all significantly related to visiting a grocery store. Home neighborhood environment, day of week, type of tour, gender, income, education level, age, and obesity status were all significantly related to likelihood of visiting a fastfood outlet.
   Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that people travel sizeable distances for food and this distance is related to urban. Results suggest that researchers need to employ different methods to characterize food environments than have been used to assess urban form in studies of physical activity. Food is most often purchased while traveling from locations other than home, so future studies should assess the food environment around work, school or other frequently visited destinations, as well as along frequently traveled routes.

AB Green tea (GT) and caffeine in combination were shown to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation, but less is known about the effects of black tea (BT) and oolong tea (OT). This study investigated whether decaffeinated polyphenol extracts from GT, BT, and OT decrease body fat and inflammation in male C57BL/6J mice fed high-fat/high-sucrose [HF/HS (32% energy from fat, 25% energy from sucrose)] diets. Mice were fed either an HF/HS diet with 0.25% of polyphenol from GT, OT, or BT or a low-fat/high-sucrose [LF/HS (10.6% energy from fat, 25% energy from sucrose)] diet for 20 wk. Monomeric tea polyphenols were found in the liver and adipose tissue of mice fed the HF/HS diet with GT polyphenols (GTPs) and OT polyphenols (OTPs) but not BT polyphenols (BTPs). Treatment with GTPs, OTPs, BTPs, and an LF/HS diet led to significantly lower body weight, total visceral fat volume by MRI, and liver lipid weight compared with mice in the HF/HS control group. Only GTPs reduced food intake significantly by similar to 10%. GTP, BTP, and LF/HS-diet treatments significantly reduced serum monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) compared with HF/HS controls. In mesenteric fat, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp1) gene expression was significantly decreased by treatment with GTPs, BTPs, OTPs, and an LF/HS diet and in liver tissue by GTP and BTP treatments. Mcp1 gene expression in epididymal fat was significantly decreased by the BTP and LF/HS diet interventions. In epididymal fat, consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect, adiponectin gene expression was significantly increased by GTPs and OTPs. Angiogenesis during adipose tissue expansion is anti-inflammatory by maintaining adipocyte perfusion. We observed significantly increased gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A by GTPs and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 by BTPs and the LF/HS diet and a decrease in pigment epithelium-derived factor gene expression by OTPs and BTPs. In summary, all 3 tea polyphenol extracts induced weight loss and anti-inflammatory and angiogenic effects, although the tissue content of polyphenols differed significantly.

AB Green tea and protein separately are able to increase diet-induced thermogenesis. Although their effects on long-term weight-maintenance were present separately, they were not additive. Therefore, the effect of milk-protein (MP) in combination with green tea on diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) was examined in 18 subjects (aged 18-60 years; BMI: 23.0 +/- 2.1 kg/m(2)). They participated in an experiment with a randomized, 6 arms, crossover design, where energy expenditure and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured. Green tea (GT) vs. placebo (PL) capsules were either given in combination with water or with breakfasts containing milk protein in two different dosages: 15 g (15 MP) (energy% P/C/F: 15/47/38; 1.7 MJ/500 mL), and 3.5 g (3.5 MP) (energy% P/C/F: 41/59/0; 146.4 kJ/100 mL). After measuring resting energy expenditure (REE) for 30 min, diet-induced energy expenditure was measured for another 3.5 h after the intervention. There was an overall significant difference observed between conditions (p < 0.001). Post-hoc, areas under the curve (AUCs) for diet-induced energy expenditure were significantly different (P <= 0.001) for GT + water (41.11 [91.72] kJ.3.5 h) vs. PL + water (10.86 [28.13] kJ.3.5 h), GT + 3.5 MP (10.14 [54.59] kJ.3.5 h) and PL + 3.5 MP (12.03 [34.09] kJ.3.5 h), but not between GT + 3.5 MP, PL + 3.5 MP and PL + water, indicating that MP inhibited DIT following GT. DIT after GT + 15 MP (167.69 [141.56] kJ.3.5 h) and PL + 15 MP (168.99 [186.56] kJ.3.5 h) was significantly increased vs. PL + water (P < 0.001), but these were not different from each other indicating that 15 g MP stimulated DIT, but inhibited the GT effect on DIT. No significant differences in RQ were seen between conditions for baseline and post-treatment. In conclusion, consumption of milk-protein inhibits the effect of green tea on DIT.

AB Background: Few studies have examined water consumption patterns among US children. Additionally, recent data on total water consumption as it relates to the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) are lacking. This study evaluated the consumption of plain water (tap and bottled) and other beverages among US children by age group, gender, income-to -poverty ratio, and race/ethnicity. Comparisons were made to DRI values for water consumption from all sources.
   Methods: Data from two non-consecutive 24-hour recalls from 3 cycles of NHANES (2005-2006, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010) were used to assess water and beverage consumption among 4,766 children age 4-13y. Beverages were classified into 9 groups: water (tap and bottled), plain and flavored milk, 100% fruit juice, soda/soft drinks (regular and diet), fruit drinks, sports drinks, coffee, tea, and energy drinks. Total water intakes from plain water, beverages, and food were compared to DRIs for the US. Total water volume per 1,000 kcal was also examined.
   Results: Water and other beverages contributed 70-75% of dietary water, with 25-30% provided by moisture in foods, depending on age. Plain water, tap and bottled, contributed 25-30% of total dietary water. In general, tap water represented 60% of drinking water volume whereas bottled water represented 40%. Non-Hispanic white children consumed the most tap water, whereas Mexican-American children consumed the most bottled water. Plain water consumption (bottled and tap) tended to be associated with higher incomes. No group of US children came close to satisfying the DRIs for water. At least 75% of children 4-8y, 87% of girls 9-13y, and 85% of boys 9-13y did not meet DRIs for total water intake. Water volume per 1,000 kcal, another criterion of adequate hydration, was 0.85-0.95 L/1,000 kcal, short of the desirable levels of 1.0-1.5 L/1,000 kcal.
   Conclusions: Water intakes at below-recommended levels may be a cause for concern. Data on water and beverage intake for the population and by socio-demographic group provides useful information to target interventions for increasing water intake among children.

AB Sales of sports and energy drinks have increased dramatically, but there is limited information on regular consumers of sports and energy drinks. Characteristics associated with sports and energy drink intake were examined among a sample representing the civilian noninstitutionalized US adult population. The 2010 National Health Interview Survey data for 25,492 adults (18 years of age or older; 48% males) were used. Nationwide, 31.3% of adults were sports and energy drink consumers during the past 7 days, with 21.5% consuming sports and energy drinks one or more times per week and 11.5% consuming sports and energy drinks three or more times per week. Based on multivariable logistic regression, younger adults, males, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, not-married individuals, adults with higher family income, those who lived in the South or West, adults who engaged in leisure-time physical activity, current smokers, and individuals whose satisfaction with their social activities/relationships was excellent had significantly higher odds for drinking sports and energy drinks one or more times per week. In this model, the factor most strongly associated with weekly sports and energy. drink consumption was age (odds ratio [OR]=10.70 for 18- to 24-year-olds, OR=6.40 for 25- to 39-year-olds, OR=3.17 for 40- to 59-year-olds vs 60 years or older). Lower odds for consuming sports and energy drinks one or more times per week were associated with other/multiracial (OR=0.80 vs non-Hispanic white) and obesity (OR=0.87 vs underweight/normal weight). Separate modeling of the association between other beverage intake and sports and energy drink intake showed that higher intake of regular soda, sweetened coffee/tea drinks, fruit drinks, milk, 100% fruit juice, and alcohol were significantly associated with greater odds for drinking sports and energy drinks one or more times per week. These findings can help medical care providers and public health officials identify adults most in need of encouragement to reduce sports and energy drink intake and increase healthier beverage intake.
