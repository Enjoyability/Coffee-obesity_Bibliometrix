AB Previous studies regarding the acute effects of coffee on glycaemic control have used a single large dose of coffee, typically containing the caffeine equivalent of 2-4 servings of coffee. This study investigates whether the acute effects of coffee are dose-dependent, starting with a single serving. A total of ten healthy overweight males participated in a two-part randomised double-blind cross-over study. In the first part, they ingested 2, 4 or 8 g instant decaffeinated coffee (DC) dissolved in 400 ml water with caffeine added in proportion to the DC (total 100, 200 or 400 mg caffeine) or control (400 ml water) all with 50 g glucose. In the second part, they ingested the same amounts of DC (2, 4, 8 g) or control, but with a standard 100 mg caffeine added to each. Capillary blood samples were taken every 15 min for 2 h after each drink and glucose and insulin levels were measured. Repeated measures ANOVA on glucose results found an effect when caffeine was varied in line with DC (P = 0.008). Post hoc analysis revealed that both 2 and 4 g DC with varied caffeine content increased the glycaemic response v. control. There was no effect of escalating doses of DC when caffeine remained constant at 100 mg. These results demonstrate that one standard serving of coffee (2 g) is sufficient to affect glucose metabolism. Furthermore, the amount of caffeine found in one serving (100 mg) is sufficient to mask any potential beneficial effects of increasing other components. No dose-dependent effect was found.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ingesting caffeine and green coffee bean extract on blood glucose and insulin concentrations during a post-exercise oral glucose tolerance test.
   Methods: Ten male cyclists (age: 26 +/- 5 y; height: 179.9 +/- 5.4 cm; weight: 77.6 +/- 13.3 kg; body mass index: 24 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2); VO2 peak: 55.9 +/- 8.4 mL.kg.min(-1)) participated in this study. In a randomized order, each participant completed three 30-min bouts of cycling at 60% of peak power output. Immediately after exercise, each participant consumed 75 g of dextrose with either 5 mg/kg body weight of caffeine, 10 mg/kg of green coffee bean extract (5 mg/kg chlorogenic acid), or placebo. Venous blood samples were collected immediately before and after exercise during completion of the oral glucose tolerance test.
   Results: No significant time x treatment effects for blood glucose and insulin were found. Two-h glucose and insulin area under the curve values, respectively, for the caffeine (658 +/- 74 mmol/L and 30,005 +/- 13,304 pmol/L), green coffee bean extract (637 +/- 100 mmol/L and 31,965 +/- 23,586 pmol/L), and placebo (661 +/- 77 mmol/L and 27,020 +/- 12,339 pmol/L) trials were not significantly different (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Caffeine and green coffee bean extract did not significantly alter postexercise blood glucose and insulin concentrations when compared with a placebo. More human research is needed to determine the impact of these combined nutritional treatments and exercise on changes in blood glucose and insulin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study was conducted to determine the effects of green coffee consumption on resting energy expenditures (REEs), blood pressure, and body temperature of individuals. Method: The study was conducted with 24 women. The REE values of the individuals were measured with the COSMED Fitmate PRO. After the first REE measurements, individuals were given 1 cup of green coffee that was prepared to contain 6 mg caffeine per kg of lean body mass. After coffee consumption, REE measurements were made at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes. Blood pressure (mm Hg) and body temperature values (degrees C) were measured simultaneously with REE measurement. Results: There was a positive correlation between the caffeine amounts given with green coffee and 30-minute (p < 0.05), 60-minute (p = 0.06), and 120-minute (p < 0.05) REE (kcal/d) values. There was also a positive correlation between the total chlorogenic acid taken with green coffee and 30-minute (p < 0.05), 60-minute (p = 0.06), and 120-minute (p < 0.05) REE (kcal/d) values. The intracellular and extracellular fluid amounts liter(l) before and after consumption of green coffee by individuals were 18.7 +/- 1.57 versus 18.6 +/- 1.44 (p < 0.05) and 11.4 +/- 1.01 versus 11.2 +/- 0.97 (p < 0.05), respectively. The body temperature (degrees C) changes observed in the individuals whose usual dietary caffeine intake was less than or equal to the 50th percentile after green coffee consumption were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Similarly, the diastolic blood pressure changes observed in the individuals whose usual dietary caffeine intake was less than or equal to the 50th percentile after green coffee consumption was almost statistically significant (p = 0.06). Conclusions: The results of this study showed that 6 mg caffeine/kg (lean body mass) intake among women changed body temperature and blood pressure values and liquid balance depending on the usual dietary coffee intake. In addition, chlorogenic acid is also correlated with REE values besides green coffee caffeine.

AB Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. It has primarily consumed due to its stimulant effect and unique taste since the ancient times. Afterwards, its consumption has been historically associated with a lower risk of some diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, cardiovascular disease and some type of cancer and thus it has also consumed due to health benefits. It contains many bioactive compounds such as caffeine, chlorogenic acids and diterpenoid alcohols which have so far been associated with many potential health benefits. For example, caffeine reduces risk of developing neurodegenerative disease and chlorogenic acids (CGA) and diterpene alcohols have many health benefits such as antioxidant and chemo-preventive. Coffee also have harmful effects. For example, diterpenoid alcohols increases serum homocysteine and cholesterol levels and thus it has adverse effects on cardiovascular system. Overall, the study that supports the health benefits of coffee is increasing. But, it is thought-provoking that the association with health benefits of coffee consumption and frequency at different levels in each study. For this reason, we aimed to examine the health effect of the coffee and how much consumption is to investigate whether it meets the claimed health benefits.

AB Chlorogenic acid as a constituent of coffee is consumed regularly in the human diet. Chlorogenic acid intake has been associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that chlorogenic acid would improve cardiovascular, liver, and metabolic responses in a rat model of metabolic syndrome induced by a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Male Wistar rats (8-9 weeks old, 335 +/- 2 g, n = 48) were divided into 4 groups and fed with corn starch diet (16 weeks); corn starch diet with chlorogenic acid in food for the last 8 weeks; high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (16 weeks); or high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet with chlorogenic acid (similar to 100 mg/kg/d) in food for the last 8 weeks. In high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-fed rats, chlorogenic acid reduced energy intake and food efficiency to reduce visceral fat, especially retroperitoneal fat, and abdominal circumference; reversed the elevated systolic blood pressure; and attenuated left ventricular diastolic stiffness with reduced collagen deposition and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the left ventricle. Chlorogenic acid decreased inflammation and fat deposition in the liver along with reduced plasma liver enzyme activities of obese rats but did not change the plasma lipid profile. Chlorogenic acid increased diversity of gut microbiota, which may improve overall metabolism in the body. Thus, chronic dietary chlorogenic acid attenuated diet-induced inflammation as well as cardiovascular, liver, and metabolic changes, suggesting that chlorogenic acid has potential for further clinical evaluation.

AB BACKGROUND: A relationship between change in coffee consumption and reduced long-term weight gain has been suggested, but current evidence is inconsistent.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine longitudinal associations between coffee consumption and changes in body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), fat-free mass index (FFMI), body fat percentage (BF %) and waist circumference (WC).
   DESIGN: The study consisted of 2128 participants from the Danish part of the MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease) cohort with repeated information on coffee consumption, adiposity measures and covariates during an 11 year period. Linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the associations between baseline coffee consumption and subsequent change in adiposity measures. The same analyses were conducted analyzing associations between change in coffee consumption and concurrent as well as subsequent changes in adiposity measures,
   RESULTS: We found no consistent evidence of associations between baseline coffee consumption and subsequent 6-year changes in adiposity measures. A statistically significant association between increased coffee consumption over a 6-year period and decreased concurrent gain in BMI, FMI, BF % and WC (-0.05 kg m(-2) (95% confidence interval (Cl): -0.07, -0.02), -0.04 kg m(-2) (95% CI: -0.06, -0.02), -0.08% (95% CI: -0.13, -0.04) and -0.23 cm (95% CI: -0.34, -0.12), respectively, per 1 cup day 1 increase in coffee consumption) was found. No association was seen between change in coffee consumption and concurrent change in FFMI. Moreover, an initial change in coffee consumption during the first 5-year period was not associated with change in adiposity during the subsequent 6-year period.
   CONCLUSIONS: Increased coffee consumption was associated with a decreased concurrent gain in body weight, fat mass and waist circumference, but the associations were weak. Moreover, a causal relationship could not be established, as we found no evidence of associations between an initial change in coffee consumption and subsequent change in adiposity.

AB Purpose The effects of regular coffee intake on weight gain and development of diabetes are reviewed. The pathophysiology of obesity and type 2 diabetes as well as the necessity of preventive options based on the increasing prevalence of these two disorders worldwide is briefly discussed. The relationship between weight gain and development of diabetes is also presented. The two major constituents in the brewed coffee, chlorogenic acids and caffeine, are responsible for many of the beneficial effects suggested by numerous epidemiological studies of coffee consumption and the development of diabetes.
   Methods A wide search of various databases, such as PubMed and Google Scholar, preceded the writing of this manuscript, focusing on key words that are part of the title. It was selected mainly review papers from in vivo, ex vivo, in vitro experimental studies in animals and human tissues as well as wide population-based epidemiological studies in the last 10 years.
   Conclusion As of today, there are mounting evidences of the reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes by regular coffee drinkers of 3-4 cups a day. The effects are likely due to the presence of chlorogenic acids and caffeine, the two constituents of coffee in higher concentration after the roasting process.

AB The purpose of this paper was to perform a review about the role of green coffee extract on weight loss, glucose and lipid metabolism. It has been shown that overweight and obesity are important problems for health and the financial and psychological aspects have been imposed many damages to governments and health care providers. The management of overweight and obesity is related to lifestyle, physical activity, and diet. In the past decade, the studies have been published about the effects of green coffee extract on hypoglycemic, weight losing and hypotensive have been increasing. there are limited number of human studies in this area. However, the majority of interventional and epidemiological studies have been shown the beneficial effects of green coffee extract on weight and blood glucose management and metabolism of lipids. Green coffee extract reduces the fat reserves in adipocytes and regulate blood glucose by several mechanisms. Accordingly, green coffee extract supplementation may be effective in weight management, glucose and lipid metabolism.

AB To investigate the mechanism of the combined effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and caffeine on lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, eighty female ICR mice were randomly divided into eight groups and fed with a high-fat diet with/without CGA and/or caffeine for 14 weeks. The combination of CGA and caffeine effectively decreased body weight gain, intraperitoneal adipose tissue weight, serum LDL-c, FFA, TC, TG, leptin, IL-6 concentrations, and hepatic TG and TC levels and increased the serum adiponectin level. The CGA and caffeine combination also promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK alpha, inhibited the expressions of transcriptional regulators (SREBP-1c and LXR alpha), and decreased the expressions of FAS and HMGR. Besides, the expressions of ACO, ATGL and HSL were increased by the CGA and caffeine combinations. The results indicated that the combination of CGA and caffeine had anti-obesity effects and regulated lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice via the AMPK alpha-LXR alpha/SREBP-1c signaling pathway. Thus, chronic CGA and caffeine intakes may be potent for preventing obesity.

AB Epidemiologic studies from several countries have found that mortality rates associated with the metabolic syndrome are inversely associated with coffee consumption. Metabolic syndrome can lead to arteriosclerosis by endothelial dysfunction, and increases the risk for myocardial and cerebral infarction. Accordingly, it is important to understand the possible protective effects of coffee against components of the metabolic syndrome, including vascular endothelial function impairment, obesity and diabetes. Coffee contains many components, including caffeine, chlorogenic acid, diterpenes and trigonelline. Studies have found that coffee polyphenols, such as chlorogenic acids, have many health-promoting properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, and antihypertensive properties. Chlorogenic acids may exert protective effects against metabolic syndrome risk through their antioxidant properties, in particular toward vascular endothelial cells, in which nitric oxide production may be enhanced, by promoting endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression. These effects indicate that coffee components may support the maintenance of normal endothelial function and play an important role in the prevention of metabolic syndrome. However, results related to coffee consumption and the metabolic syndrome are heterogeneous among studies, and the mechanisms of its functions and corresponding molecular targets remain largely elusive. This review describes the results of studies exploring the putative effects of coffee components, especially in protecting vascular endothelial function and preventing metabolic syndrome.

AB Background: Metabolic syndrome is one of the most important health issues worldwide. Obesity causes insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and various diseases throughout the body. The liver phenotype, which is called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), frequently progresses to hepatocellular carcinoma. We recently established a new animal model, Tsumura-Suzuki obese diabetic (TSOD) mice, which spontaneously exhibit obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and NASH with liver nodules.
   Methods: We examined the effects of coffee intake on various conditions of the metabolic syndrome using TSOD mice. The daily volume of coffee administered was limited so that it reflected the appropriate quantities consumed in humans. To clarify the effects of the specific components, animals were divided into two coffee-intake groups that included with and without caffeine.
   Results: Coffee intake did not significantly affect obesity and hyperlipidemia in TSOD mice. In contrast, coffee intake caused various degrees of improvement in the pancreatic beta cell damage and steatohepatitis with liver carcinogenesis. Most of the effects were believed to be caused by a synergistic effect of caffeine with other components such as polyphenols. However, the antifibrotic effects of coffee appeared to be due to the polyphenols rather than the caffeine.
   Conclusions: A daily habit of drinking coffee could possibly play a role in the prevention of metabolic syndrome.

AB Background: Maternal caffeine intake is associated with adverse birth outcomes, but its long-term influence on offspring adiposity outcomes is not well studied. Furthermore, few studies have investigated paternal and grandparental caffeine intake in relation to offspring outcomes.
   Objective: To study the associations between maternal, paternal, and grandparental caffeine intake and offspring childhood adiposity.
   Design: The core study sample consists of 558 mother-child pairs from the Lifeways Study. Caffeine intake was derived from relevant food items in a self-administered validated food frequency questionnaire in early pregnancy. Children's body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were measured at 5- and 9-y follow-up. Childhood overall and central obesity were defined as age-and sex-specific BMI z-score > International Obesity Task Force cut-off and WC z-score > 90th percentile, respectively. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to assess associations.
   Results: Study mothers had a mean age of 30.8 y and a mean prepregnancy BMI (kg/m(2)) of 23.7. In adjusted models, maternal caffeine intake was associated with a higher offspring BMI z-score [beta (95% CI): 0.13 (0.06, 0.21) for year 5 and 0.17 (0.04, 0.29) for year 9; per 100 mg/d increment in maternal caffeine intake], WC z-score [beta (95% CI): 0.09 (0.01, 0.17) for year 5 and 0.19 (0.05, 0.32) for year 9], and a higher risk of offspring overall obesity [OR (95% CI): 1.32 (1.11, 1.57) for year 5 and 1.44 (1.10, 1.88) for year 9] and central obesity [1.28 (1.02, 1.60) for year 5 and 1.62 (1.12, 2.34) for year 9]. The influence was stronger for coffee caffeine than tea caffeine. No consistent associations were observed for paternal and grandparental caffeine intake.
   Conclusions: Maternal antenatal, but not paternal or grandparental, caffeine intake is associated with higher offspring adiposity and obesity risk at age 5 and 9 y, with stronger associations observed for coffee caffeine. This prospective observational study was registered at the ISRCTN Registry as ISRCTN16537904.

AB Background: Tea and coffee are the second and third most consumed beverages after water, respectively. The high consumption of these beverages is due to the sensorial properties and effects on psychological and physiological functions, induced by caffeine and many other bioactive components responsible for the protective effects on human health generally ascribed to these beverages.
   Methods: The goal of this review article is to collect the scientific data obtained from clinical trials published in the last five years on the role of tea and coffee consumption against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and CVD risk factors such as hypertension, hyperglicemia, and hyperlipidaemia.
   Results: In normal weight subjects, clinical trials showed that the consumption of tea is inversely associated to CVD risk factors or no association was found. Differently, in overweight subjects, the clinical trials and the metaanalyses showed an inverse correlation between tea consumption and CVDs. As regards coffee, it has long been suspected to be associated to high risk of CVDs. Nevertheless, some recent investigations reported that moderate coffee consumption have no effect or even protective effects against CVDs risk factors. The results of the metaanalyses confirm this trend suggesting that moderate coffee drinkers could be associated to a lower risk of CVDs than non-or occasional coffee drinkers or no association can be demonstrated between coffee consumption and CVDs.
   Conclusion: Literature data on tea consumption and CVD risk factors support that tea consumption reduces some risk factors especially in overweight people and obese subjects. Therefore, these results seem to suggest that tea could exert a protective effects against CVD development. As regards coffee, the results are controversial and did not allow to draw conclusions. Therefore, further research is needed before definitive recommendations for coffee consumption against CVD development can be made.

AB Chlorogenic acids from coffee show high antioxidant activity that contributes to inhibition of oxidative stress, which results in anticancer, antidiabetic and antiobesity coffee activities. Coffee roasting causes their partial decomposition and partial incorporation into Maillard reaction products also of high antioxidant activity, and it is still not clear whether more favorable impact on health is associated with the consumption of green or roasted coffee. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of coffee roasting process and also of the degree of chlorogenic acid esterification on bioactivity of coffee extracts. Extracts of green and roasted coffee and their fractions containing mono- and dichlorogenic acids (six extracts) were obtained by purification and optional fractionation of crude extracts using preparative centrifugal partition chromatography technique. The extracts were evaluated in vitro in terms of scavenging capacity, influence on lipids accumulation in 3T3L1 adipocytes, cytoprotective potential decreasing oxidative stress induced by cellular pro-oxidants in beta TC3 cells, and in vivo by selected physiological indices in rats fed diets supplemented with the extracts. Roasted coffee extracts, in particular hydrophilic fraction containing monochlorogenic acids and Maillard reaction products, showed the highest scavenging capacity and contributed to the highest level of antioxidants in the hydrophilic fraction of rats serum and may be potentially used as anticancer nutraceutical with oxidative stress inhibitor activity. Non-fractionated green coffee extract exhibited antidiabetic activities including inhibition of adipogenesis, while in vivo it significantly lowered the levels of triglycerides, glucose and oxidized glutathione.

AB Obesity and overweight are major health issues. Exercise and calorie intake control are recognized as the primary mechanisms for addressing excess body weight. Naturally occurring thermogenic plant constituents offer adjunct means for assisting in weight management. The controlling mechanisms for thermogenesis offer many intervention points. Thermogenic agents can act through stimulation of the central nervous system with associated adverse cardiovascular effects and through metabolic mechanisms that are non-stimulatory or a combination thereof. Examples of stimulatory thermogenic agents that will be discussed include ephedrine and caffeine. Examples of non-stimulatory thermogenic agents include p-synephrine (bitter orange extract), capsaicin, forskolin (Coleus root extract), and chlorogenic acid (green coffee bean extract). Green tea is an example of a thermogenic with the potential to produce mild but clinically insignificant undesirable stimulatory effects. The use of the aforementioned thermogenic agents in combination with other extracts such as those derived from Salacia reticulata, Sesamum indicum, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Cissus quadrangularis, and Moringa olifera, as well as the use of the carotenoids as lutein and fucoxanthin, and flavonoids as naringin and hesperidin can further facilitate energy metabolism and weight management as well as sports performance without adverse side effects.

AB Coffee consumption is associated with reduced risk of metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes, which may be related to the effects of coffee and its bioactive components on lipid metabolism. Coffee contains caffeine, a known neuromodulator that acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist, as well as other components, such as chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, cafestol and kahweol. Thus, this review discusses the up-to-date knowledge of mechanisms of action of coffee and its bioactive compounds on lipid metabolism. Although there is evidence that coffee and/or its bioactive compounds regulate transcription factors (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and sterol regulatory element binding proteins) and enzymes (e.g. AMP-activated protein kinase) involved in lipogenesis, lipid uptake, transport, fatty acid beta-oxidation and/or lipolysis, needs for the understanding of coffee and its effects on lipid metabolism in humans remain to be answered.

AB Epidemiological studies have found coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, the aim of this randomised, cross-over single-blind study was to investigate the effects of regular coffee, regular coffee with sugar and decaffeinated coffee consumption on glucose metabolism and incretin hormones. Seventeen healthy men participated in five trials each, during which they consumed coffee (decaffeinated, regular (containing caffeine) or regular with sugar) or water (with or without sugar). After 1 h of each intervention, they received an oral glucose tolerance test with one intravenous dose of [1-C-13] glucose. The Oral Dose Intravenous Label Experiment was applied and glucose and insulin levels were interpreted using a stable isotope two-compartment minimal model. A mixed-model procedure (PROC MIXED), with subject as random effect and time as repeated measure, was used to compare the effects of the beverages on glucose metabolism and incretin parameters (glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP)) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)). Insulin sensitivity was higher with decaffeinated coffee than with water (P<0.05). Regular coffee with sugar did not significantly affect glucose, insulin, C-peptide and incretin hormones, compared with water with sugar. Glucose, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1 and GIP levels were not statistically different after regular and decaffeinated coffee compared with water. Our findings demonstrated that the consumption of decaffeinated coffee improves insulin sensitivity without changing incretin hormones levels. There was no short-term adverse effect on glucose homoeostasis, after an oral glucose challenge, attributable to the consumption of regular coffee with sugar.

AB Background and objective: Green coffee bean extract is used as herbal medicine or supplement for weight reduction and obesity. The active constituents are considered caffeine and chlorogenic acid (CGA) derivatives. The mode of action of CGA is still unclear and can be related to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPAR-alpha) and liver X receptor R alpha (LXR-alpha). Metabolomics may be an innovative tool for the description and discovery of the multiple target nature of such phytocomplex.
   Methods: 24 h urine samples were collected once a week from ten healthy adult volunteers consuming daily 400 mg of dry Green coffee bean extract (GCBE, 4.9% of chlorogenic acid) each day for 30 days (5 harvesting days, considering also the first day of supplementation). Urine samples were analyzed by LC-QTOF using both untargeted and targeted approaches. The latter was used to monitor two urinary markers of oxidative stress (allantoin, 8-OHdG).
   Results: Metabolomics analysis (PLS-DA) revealed changes in urine composition before and during the treatment with GCBE. Markers related to treatment were metabolites related to polyphenol administration as hippuric acid, benzoic acid derivatives, dihydroferulic and dihydrosinapic acid sulphate, but also carnitine derivatives and dicarboxylic acids. On the other hand, no changes in the levels of allantoin and 8-OHdG were observed.
   Conclusion: This preliminary study showed the possible usefulness of metabolomics approach in the evaluation of GCBE consumption in healthy subjects. The observed changes in urinary composition can be related to the catabolism of GCBE constituents and to induced fatty acid metabolism, mainly related to carnitine derivatives. This latter result could be considered, at least in part, as a further proof of the mode of action of green coffee extract.

AB Background: Overweight subjects easily develop alterations of the glucose and lipid metabolism and are exposed to an increased cardiometabolic risk. This condition is potentially reversible through the improvement of dietary and behavioural habits. However, a well-assembled nutraceutical would be a useful tool to better improve the metabolic parameters associated to overweight and insulin resistance.
   Methods: To evaluate the effect of a combined nutraceutical containing berberine, chlorogenic acid and tocotrienols, we performed a double blind, cross-over designed trial versus placebo, in 40 overweight subjects with mixed hyperlipidaemia. After the first 8 weeks of treatment (or placebo), patients were asked to observe a 2-week washout period, and they were then assigned to the alternative treatment for a further period of 8 weeks. Clinical and laboratory data associated to hyperlipidaemia and insulin resistance have been obtained at the baseline, at the end of the first treatment period, after the washout, and again after the second treatment period.
   Results: Both groups experienced a significant improvement of anthropometric and biochemical parameters versus baseline. However, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, GOT and Lipid Accumulation Product decreased more significantly in the nutraceutical group versus placebo.
   Conclusions: This combination seems to improve a large number of metabolic and liver parameters on the short-term in overweight subjects. Further studies are needed to confirm these observations on the middle-and long-term.

AB Background and Objectives: Obesity has become a public health problem and is a cause of some preventable illnesses. Among several methods for treating obesity, the use of food supplements is highly common. A commonly used food supplement is green coffee bean extract. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of green coffee bean extract combined with an energy-restricted diet on the body composition and serum adipocytokines in obese women. Methods and Study Design: In this randomised clinical trial, 64 obese women aged 20-45 years were selected and divided into two groups: an intervention group (receiving 400 mg green coffee bean extract for 8 weeks) and control group (receiving placebo). All participants were on an energy-restricted diet. The body composition, leptin, adiponectin, lipid profile, free fatty acids (FFAs), and fasting blood sugar were compared between the two groups. Results: We observed significant reductions in the body weight, body mass and fat mass indices, and waist-to-hip circumference ratio in both groups; however, the decrease was higher in the intervention group. Moreover, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, leptin, and plasma free fatty acids significantly decreased in the intervention group (p<0.05) after adjustment for energy and fibre intake. The serum adiponectin concentration significantly increased in the intervention group (p<0.05). Conclusions: Green coffee bean extract combined with an energy-restricted diet affects fat accumulation and lipid metabolism and is thus an inexpensive method for weight control in obese people.

AB Objective: The associations of maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy with offspring growth patterns and body fat and insulin levels at school age were examined.
   Methods: In a population-based birth cohort among 7,857 mothers and their children, maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy was assessed by questionnaires. Growth characteristics were measured from birth onward. At 6 years, body fat and insulin levels were measured.
   Results: Compared to children whose mothers consumed <2 units of caffeine per day during pregnancy (1 unit of caffeine is equivalent to 1 cup of coffee (90 mg caffeine)), those whose mothers consumed >= 6 units of caffeine per day tended to have a lower weight at birth, higher weight gain from birth to 6 years, and higher body mass index from 6 months to 6 years. Both children whose mothers consumed 4-5.9 and >= 6 units of caffeine per day during pregnancy tended to have a higher childhood body mass index and total body fat mass. Only children whose mothers consumed >= 6 units of caffeine per day had a higher android/gynoid fat mass ratio.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that high levels of maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy are associated with adverse offspring growth patterns and childhood body fat distribution.

AB The effects of chronic coffee exposure in models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is scarcely studied, and the efficacy of the main coffee species has never been compared. We tested the hypothesis that long-term consumption of arabica and robusta coffee may differentially delay and affect T2D development in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Three study groups received either chow mixed with arabica or robusta instant coffee (1.8% w/w) or unsupplemented chow food for 10 weeks. Both coffee species reduced liver triglyceride content and area under the curve of fasting and postprandial insulin. At study end, plasma adiponectin, total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein levels were higher in the robust group compared with both arabica and control groups. The liver gene expression of Glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit (G6pc) and Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in robusta and Cpt1a in both coffee groups was downregulated. In conclusion, long-term consumption of both coffee species reduced weight gain and liver steatosis and improved insulin sensitivity in a rat model of T2D. Robusta coffee was seemingly superior to arabica coffee with respect to effects on lipid profile, adiponectin level and hepatic gene expression.

AB Chlorogenic acid (CGA), an important biologically active dietary polyphenol, is produced by certain plant species and is a major component of coffee. Reduction in the risk of a variety of diseases following CGA consumption has been mentioned in recent basic and clinical research studies. This systematic review discusses in vivo animal and human studies of the physiological and biochemical effects of chlorogenic acids (CGAs) on biomarkers of chronic disease. We searched PubMed, Embase, Amed and Scopus using the following search terms: ("chlorogenic acid" OR "green coffee bean extract") AND (human OR animal) (last performed on April 1st, 2015) for relevant literature on the in vivo effects of CGAs in animal and human models, including clinical trials on cardiovascular, metabolic, cancerogenic, neurological and other functions. After exclusion of editorials and letters, uncontrolled observations, duplicate and not relevant publications the remaining 94 studies have been reviewed. The biological properties of CGA in addition to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects have recently been reported. It is postulated that CGA is able to exert pivotal roles on glucose and lipid metabolism regulation and on the related disorders, e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, cancer, and hepatic steatosis. The wide range of potential health benefits of CGA, including its anti-diabetic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity impacts, may provide a non-pharmacological and non-invasive approach for treatment or prevention of some chronic diseases. In this study, the effects of CGAs on different aspects of health by reviewing the related literatures have been discussed.

AB Coffee consumption is associated with reduced risk of conditions that share low-grade inflammation as their physiopathological basis. We therefore summarized the effects of coffee or coffee components on serum levels of inflammatory markers. Clinical trials assessing the effect of coffee, caffeine or other coffee components on inflammatory markers were searched without restriction to publication date. Fifteen studies (8 involving coffee and 7 caffeine) were included. Increased adiponectin levels were found in four of seven trials comparing filtered coffee/caffeinated coffee with placebo or comparing its levels at baseline and after consumption of medium or dark roasted coffee, but no change was seen in caffeine trials. None of the five studies assessing the effects of coffee found changes in C-reactive protein (CPR), but one out of three trials found decreased CPR levels in response to caffeine. Interleukin (IL)-6 was increased by caffeinated coffee compared with placebo in one of four coffee trials, and by caffeine in three out of five studies. Caffeine increased IL-10 levels in two of three trials. These data suggest a predominant anti-inflammatory action of coffee but not of caffeine consumption. Moreover, the proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses to caffeine point to its complex effects on the inflammatory response.

AB Coffee is a composite mixture of more than a thousand diverse phytochemicals like alkaloids, phenolic compounds, vitamins, carbohydrates, lipids, minerals and nitrogenous compounds. Coffee has multifunctional properties as a food additive and nutraceutical. As a nutraceutical, coffee has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antidyslipidemic, anti-obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which can serve for the treatment and prevention of metabolic syndrome and associated disorders. On the other hand, as a food additive, coffee has antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms, inhibits lipid peroxidation (LPO), and can function as a prebiotic. The outcomes of different studies also revealed that coffee intake may reduce the incidence of numerous chronic diseases, like liver disease, mental health, and it also overcomes the all-cause mortality, and suicidal risks. In some studies, high intake of coffee is linked to increase CVD risk factors, like cholesterol, plasma homocysteine and blood pressure (BP). There is also a little evidence that associated the coffee consumption with increased risk of lung tumors in smokers. Among adults who consume the moderate amount of coffee, there is slight indication of health hazards with strong indicators of health benefits. Moreover, existing literature suggests that it may be cautious for pregnant women to eliminate the chances of miscarriages and impaired fetal growth. The primary purpose of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the findings of the positive impacts and risks of coffee consumption on human health. In conclusion, to date, the best available evidence from research indicates that drinking coffee up to 3-4 cups/day provides health benefits for most people.

AB Many studies have explored the relationship between coffee-one of the most commonly consumed beverages today-and obesity. Despite inconsistent results, the relationship has not been systematically summarized. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis by compiling data from 12 epidemiologic studies identified from PubMed and Embase through February 2019. The included studies assessed obesity by body mass index (BMI, a measure of overall adiposity) or waist circumference (WC, a measure of central adiposity); analyzed the measure as a continuous outcome or binary outcome. Using random effects model, weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained for continuous outcomes; summary relative risk (RR) and 95% CI for the highest vs. lowest categories of coffee intake were estimated for binary outcome. For BMI, WMD was -0.08 (95% CI -0.14, -0.02); RR was 1.49 (95% CI 0.97, 2.29). For WC, WMD was -0.27 (95% CI -0.51, -0.02) and RR was 1.07 (95% CI 0.84, 1.36). In subgroup analysis by sex, evidence for an inverse association was more evident in men, specifically for continuous outcome, with WMD -0.05 (95% CI -0.09, -0.02) for BMI and -0.21 (95% CI -0.35, -0.08) for WC. Our meta-analysis suggests that higher coffee intake might be modestly associated with reduced adiposity, particularly in men.

AB Purpose The hypothesis was tested that coffee types differing in content of major constituents also differ with regard to cardiometabolic effects.
   Methods Overweight persons (n = 118) were randomized to consume a dark roast [rich in N-methylpyridinium (NMP)] or medium roast (rich in caffeoylquinic acids, trigonelline) coffee blend for 3 months, after a washout period of 4 weeks. Before and after the intervention period, body weight and 15 further general and biochemical parameters were determined.
   Results Participants consumed an average of 4-5 cups per day. Mean body weight, body mass index and waist circumference did not change during the coffee consumption phase in either of the study groups. Systolic blood pressure decreased in the dark roast coffee group only (p < 0.05). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased in the medium roast coffee group only, and triglyceride levels increased in the dark roast coffee group only. Glucoregulation and insulin levels were not affected, although there was a small increase of hemoglobin A1c values in both groups. An increase of adiponectin levels occurred in the medium roast coffee group only and was negatively associated with NMP concentrations. Differences did not remain statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.
   Conclusion Medium and dark roast coffee blends exert small but possibly relevant different cardiometabolic effects. Further studies of health outcomes in relation to coffee constituents seem warranted.

AB Coffee, a major dietary source of caffeine, is among the most widely consumed beverages in the world and has received considerable attention regarding health risks and benefits. We conducted a genome-wide (GW) meta-analysis of predominately regular-type coffee consumption (cups per day) among up to 91 462 coffee consumers of European ancestry with top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) followed-up in similar to 30 062 and 7964 coffee consumers of European and African-American ancestry, respectively. Studies from both stages were combined in a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Confirmed loci were examined for putative functional and biological relevance. Eight loci, including six novel loci, met GW significance (log(10)Bayes factor (BF) > 5.64) with per-allele effect sizes of 0.03-0.14 cups per day. Six are located in or near genes potentially involved in pharmacokinetics (ABCG2, AHR, POR and CYP1A2) and pharmacodynamics (BDNF and SLC6A4) of caffeine. Two map to GCKR and MLXIPL genes related to metabolic traits but lacking known roles in coffee consumption. Enhancer and promoter histone marks populate the regions of many confirmed loci and several potential regulatory SNPs are highly correlated with the lead SNP of each. SNP alleles near GCKR, MLXIPL, BDNF and CYP1A2 that were associated with higher coffee consumption have previously been associated with smoking initiation, higher adiposity and fasting insulin and glucose but lower blood pressure and favorable lipid, inflammatory and liver enzyme profiles (P < 5x10(-8)). Our genetic findings among European and African-American adults reinforce the role of caffeine in mediating habitual coffee consumption and may point to molecular mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in pharmacological and health effects of coffee.

AB Habitual coffee and caffeine consumption has been reported to be associated with numerous health outcomes. This perspective focuses on Mendelian Randomization (MR) approaches for determining whether such associations are causal. Genetic instruments for coffee and caffeine consumption are described, along with key concepts of MR and particular challenges when applying this approach to studies of coffee and caffeine. To date, at least fifteen MR studies have investigated the causal role of coffee or caffeine use on risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, gout, osteoarthritis, cancers, sleep disturbances and other substance use. Most studies provide no consistent support for a causal role of coffee or caffeine on these health outcomes. Common study limitations include low statistical power, potential pleiotropy, and risk of collider bias. As a result, in many cases a causal role cannot confidently be ruled out. Conceptual challenges also arise from the different aspects of coffee and caffeine use captured by current genetic instruments. Nevertheless, with continued genome-wide searches for coffee and caffeine related loci along with advanced statistical methods and MR designs, MR promises to be a valuable approach to understanding the causal impact that coffee and caffeine have in human health.

AB Scope: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fenugreek furostanolic saponins (Fenfuro (TM)) either alone or in combination with chlorogenic acid (GCB-70 (TM)) on insulin resistance in mice.
   Methods and results: Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a normal or high-fat diet (HFD) and were randomly assigned to receive Fenfuro (TM), GCB-70 (TM), or their combination for 24 wk. Metabolic parameters, glucose tolerance, serum triglycerides, cardiac function, and hepatic insulin signaling were evaluated using indirect open-circuit calorimetry, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, oil red O staining, echocardiography, and Western blotting, respectively. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test revealed glucose intolerance in the mice receiving HFD, which was attenuated by Fenfuro (TM). Serum triglyceride that was elevated following an HFD was reconciled by both Fenfuro (TM) and the combination. HFD compromised myocardial contractile function, which was unaffected by the treatment. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Protein kinase B (AKT) in the liver was attenuated in mice receiving HFD, which was partially rescued by GCB-70 (TM). Neither treatment altered metabolic parameters or energy expenditure.
   Conclusion: Collectively, our data suggest that fenugreek furostanolic saponins and green coffee bean extract may have potential benefits in treating insulin resistance and related conditions.

AB Context: Obesity is a major global health problem associated with various adverse effects. Pharmacological interventions are often necessary for the management of obesity. Orlistat is an FDA-approved antiobesity drug which is a potent inhibitor of intestinal lipases. Objective: In the current study, orlistat was evaluated for its genotoxic potential in human lymphocyte cells in vitro and was compared with that of another antiobesity drug sibutramine, presently withdrawn from market due its undesirable health effects. Caffeine intake may be an additional burden in people using anorectic drugs, therefore, further work is needed to be carried out to evaluate the possible effects of caffeine on orlistat-induced DNA damage. Materials and methods: Human lymphocytes were exposed to orlistat (250, 500 and 1000 mu g/ml), sibutramine (250, 500 and 1000 mu g/ml) and caffeine (25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 mu g/ml) to assess their genotoxicity by comet assay in vitro. In addition, lymphocytes were co-incubated with caffeine (50, 75 and 100 mu g/ml) and a single concentration of orlistat (250 mu g/ml). Results: Orlistat and sibutramine were genotoxic at all concentrations tested, sibutramine being more genotoxic. Caffeine was found to be genotoxic at concentrations 125 mu g/ml and above. Co-treatment of orlistat with non-genotoxic concentrations (50, 75 and 100 mu g/ml) of caffeine lead to a decrease in DNA damage. Discussion and conclusion: Orlistat can induce DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro and caffeine was found to reduce orlistat-induced genotoxicity.

AB Background: Low levels of caffeine ingestion do not induce dehydration at rest, while it is not clear if larger doses do have an acute diuretic effect. The aim of the present investigation was to examine the acute effect of low and high levels of caffeine, via coffee, on fluid balance in habitual coffee drinkers (at least one per day) at rest.
   Methods: Ten healthy adults (eight males and two females; age: 27 +/- 5 years, weight: 89.5 +/- 14.8 kg, height: 1.75 +/- 0.08 m, and body mass index: 29.1 +/- 4.4 kg m(-2)) ingested 200 mL of water (W), coffee with low caffeine (3 mg kg(-1), LCAF), or coffee with high caffeine (6 mg kg(-1), HCAF) on three respective separate occasions. All sessions were performed at 09: 00 in the morning in a counterbalanced, crossover manner, at least 5 days apart. Subjects remained in the laboratory while urine samples were collected every 60 min for 3 h post ingestion.
   Results: Absolute caffeine consumption was 269 +/- 45 and 537 +/- 89 mg for the LCAF and HCAF, respectively. Coffee ingestion at the HCAF trial induced greater diuresis during the 3-h period (613 +/- 101 mL, P < 0.05), when compared to W (356 +/- 53 mL) and LCAF (316 +/- 38 mL). In addition, cumulative urinary osmotic excretion was significantly greater in the HCAF (425 +/- 92 mmol, P < 0.05), as compared to the W (249 +/- 36 mmol) and LCAF (177 +/- 16 mmol) trials.
   Conclusion: The data indicate that caffeine intake of 6 mg kg(-1) in the form of coffee can induce an acute diuretic effect, while 3 mg kg(-1) do not disturb fluid balance in healthy casual coffee drinking adults at rest.

AB Background: Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages. We tested the hypothesis that genetically high coffee intake is associated with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and with related components thereof.
   Methods: We included 93 179 individuals from two large general population cohorts in a Mendelian randomization study. We tested first whether high coffee intake is associated with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and with related components thereof, in observational analyses; second, whether five genetic variants near the CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and AHR genes are associated with coffee intake; and third, whether the genetic variants are associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and with related components thereof. Finally, we tested the genetic association with type 2 diabetes in a meta-analysis including up to 78 021 additional individuals from the DIAGRAM consortium.
   Results: Observationally, high coffee intake was associated with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Further, high coffee intake was associated with high body mass index, waist circumference, weight, height, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides and total cholesterol and with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but not with glucose levels. In genetic analyses, 9-10 vs 0-3 coffee-intake alleles were associated with 29% higher coffee intake. However, genetically derived high coffee intake was not associated convincingly with obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, waist circumference, weight, height, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or glucose levels. Perallele meta-analysed odds ratios for type 2 diabetes were 1.01 (0.98-1.04) for AHR rs4410790, 0.98 (0.95-1.01) for AHR rs6968865, 1.01 (0.99-1.03) for CYP1A1/2 rs2470893, 1.01 (0.98-1.03) for CYP1A1/2 rs2472297 and 0.98 (0.95-1.01) for CYP1A1 rs2472299.
   Conclusions: High coffee intake was associated observationally with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and was associated observationally with related components thereof, but with no genetic evidence to support corresponding causal relationships.

AB Abdominal obesity is a major risk factor for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Dietary fat induces insulin resistance in humans and rodents. The current study investigates whether a Chlorogenic acid/Chromium III supplement rescues obesity and insulin resistance caused by high-fat feeding of male C57BL/6 J mice for 7 weeks. Administering an oral daily dose of this supplement in the last 3 weeks of feeding reversed diet-induced body weight gain and insulin resistance, assessed by hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and insulin intolerance. Indirect calorimetry analysis revealed that this effect is mediated at least partly, by increasing energy expenditure and spontaneous locomoter activity. These findings underscore the important role that chlorogenic acid and chromium play in maintaining glucose metabolism and insulin response in mice fed a high-fat diet.

AB Metabolic syndrome, especially obesity, increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We hypothesised that green coffee will attenuate metabolic, cardiovascular and liver parameters in high-carbohydrate high-fat diet-fed rats. Male Wistar rats (8-9 weeks old) were divided into 6 groups and fed for 16 weeks with either corn starch diet (C), C with either 5% green or decaffeinated green coffee in food for the last 8 weeks, high-carbohydrate high-fat diet (H) or H with either 5% green or decaffeinated green coffee in food for the last 8 weeks. Green coffee contained chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, caffeine and diterpenoids; decaffeinated green coffee contained these compounds but no caffeine. Green coffee attenuated body weight, systolic blood pressure, inflammation in the heart and liver and diastolic stiffness without improving glucose sensitivity or plasma lipids. We suggest that chlorogenic acids, trigonelline and diterpenoids in green coffee attenuate diet-induced abnormalities in heart and liver.

AB Purpose Chlorogenic acid (CGA), the most abundant component in coffee, has exhibited many biological activities. The objective of this study is to assess preventive and therapeutic effects of CGA on obesity and obesity-related liver steatosis and insulin resistance.
   Methods Two sets of experiments were conducted. In set I, 6-week old C57BL/6 mice were fed a regular chow or high-fat diet (HFD) for 15 weeks with twice intra-peritoneal (IP) injection of CGA (100 mg/kg) or DMSO (carrier solution) per week. In set 2, obese mice (average 50 g) were treated by CGA (100 mg/kg, IP, twice weekly) or DMSO for 6 weeks. Body weight, body composition and food intake were monitored. Blood glucose, insulin and lipid levels were measured at end of the study. Hepatic lipid accumulation and glucose homeostasis were evaluated. Additionally, genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation were analyzed by real time PCR.
   Results CGA significantly blocked the development of diet-induced obesity but did not affect body weight in obese mice. CGA treatment curbed HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Quantitative PCR analysis shows that CGA treatment suppressed hepatic expression of Ppar gamma, Cd36, Fabp4, and Mgot I gene. CGA treatment also attenuated inflammation in the liver and white adipose tissue accompanied by a decrease in mRNA levels of macrophage marker genes including F4/80, Cd68, Cd11b, Cd11c, and Tnf alpha, Mcp-1 and Ccr2 encoding inflammatory proteins.
   Conclusion Our study provides direct evidence in support of CGA as a potent compound in preventing diet-induced obesity and obesity-related metabolic syndrome. Our results suggest that drinking coffee is beneficial in maintaining metabolic homeostasis when on a high fat diet.

AB Context: Adiantum capillus-veneris L. (Adiantaceae) hypocholesterolemic activity is therapeutically praised.
   Objectives: Pharmacological modulation of pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PL) and alpha-amylase/alpha-glucosidase by A. capillus-veneris are evaluated.
   Materials and methods: Using positive controls (acarbose, orlistat, guar gum, atorvastatin, glipizide and metformin) as appropriate, crude aqueous extracts (AEs) of A. capillus-veneris aerial parts were tested via a combination of in vitro enzymatic (0.24-100 mg/mL), acute in vivo carbohydrate tolerance tests (125, 250 or 500 mg/kg body weight [b.wt]) and chronic in vivo studies (500 mg/kg b.wt) in high cholesterol diet (HCD) fed Wistar rats.
   Results: Like acarbose, A. capillus-veneris as well as chlorogenic acid, with respective IC50 values (mg/mL) of 0.8 +/- 0.0 and 0.2 +/- 0.0, were identified as in vitro potent dual inhibitors of alpha-amylase/alpha-glucosidase. Unlike guar gum, A. capillus-veneris had no glucose diffusion hindrance capacity. Equivalent to orlistat, A. capillus-veneris and its phytoconstituents inhibited PL in vitro with an ascending order of PL-IC50 values (mu g/mL): ferulic acid; 0.48 +/- 0.06< ellagic acid; 13.53 +/- 1.83< chlorogenic acid; 38.4 +/- 2.8< A. capillus-veneris; 1600 +/- 100. Incomparable to acarbose or metformin and glipizide, A. capillus-veneris (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg b.wt) lacked antihyperglycaemic efficacies in acute starch- or glucose-evoked postprandial hyperglycaemia increments in normoglycaemic overnight fasting rats. Superior to atorvastatin; A. capillus-veneris exerted significant antiobesity (p< 0.001) with marked triacylglycerol-reducing capacities (p< 0.001) in comparison to rats fed with HCD for 10 weeks.
   Discussion and conclusion: A. capillus-veneris, modulating pancreatic digestive enzymes, may be advocated as a combinatorial diabesity prevention/phytotherapy agent.

AB We performed an experimental research in Sprague-Dawley rats in order to evaluate the effects of different caffeinated beverages on obesity. Animals were divided in 4 groups and received beverages containing different concentration of caffeine: a commercial Energy Drink, a commercial Cola Soda, regular coffee and water. After 15 days we found that Energy Drink and Cola Soda induced body weight gain, on contrary sweetened coffee and water did not influence weight. Besides, an increased reactivity and motility was observed in the Energy Drink supplemented animals. Laboratory tests excluded obesity-correlated dysmetabolism. We supposed a central nervous action of some components of Energy Drink other than caffeine, even if their finest mechanisms are unknown. At long term, degeneration from a condition of body weight gain to obesity cannot be excluded.

AB This study was conducted to elucidate the effects of decaffeinated green coffee bean extract (GCE) on anthropometric indices, glycaemic control, blood pressure, lipid profile, insulin resistance and appetite in patients with the metabolic syndrome (Mets). Subjects were randomly allocated to consume 400 mg GCE or placebo capsules twice per d for 8 weeks. Both groups were advised to follow an energy balanced diet. After GCE supplementation, systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly reduced compared with the placebo group (-13.76 (SD 8.48) v. -6.56 (SD 9.58) mmHg, P = 0.01). Also, GCE treatment significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBS) (-5.15 (SD 60.22) v. 29.42 (SD 40.01) mg/dl (-0.28 (SD 3.34) v. 1.63 (SD 2.22) mmol/l); P = 0.03) and homoeostatic model of assessment of insulin resistance in comparison to placebo (-1.41 (SD 3.33) v. 1.23 (SD 3.84), P = 0.02). In addition, waist circumference (-2.40 (SD 2.54) v. -0.66 (SD 1.17) cm, P = 0.009) and appetite score (-1.44 (SD 1.72) v. -0.2 (SD 1.32), P = 0.01) of the individuals supplemented with GCE indicated a significant decline. Besides, weight and BMI reduction in the intervention group was almost twice as much as the placebo group; however, this discrepancy was marginally significant (weight: -2.08 (SD 2.11) v. -0.92 (SD 1.30) kg, P = 0.05). No difference was observed in terms of glycated Hb (HbA1c) percentage and lipid profile parameters between the two groups. To sum up, GCE administration had an ameliorating effect on some of the Mets components such as high SBP, high FBS and Mets main aetiological factors including insulin resistance and abdominal obesity. Furthermore, GCE supplementation could reduce appetite level.

AB Results from studies investigating the association between coffee consumption and the metabolic syndrome in Koreans have been inconsistent and remain controversial. We examined coffee intake in relation to the metabolic syndrome using data from the. Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2012-2015, with 8387 adults aged 19-64 years. Furthermore, we conducted a stratified analysis by obesity status (BMI <25 v. >= 25 kg/m(2)) to examine whether the association varied by obesity status. A 112-item FFQ was used to assess diet. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association of coffee consumption (<1, 1-2, 3-4 and >= 5 times/d) and the metabolic syndrome. Compared to people who consumed <1 time/d of coffee, the OR for the metabolic syndrome in those who consumed 3-4 times/d of coffee was 0.75 (95% CI 0.58, 0.97). However, >= 5 times/d of coffee consumption was not significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome. By obesity status, in non-obese people, those consuming more coffee had lower odds of the metabolic syndrome, showing a significant linear trend (P-trend =0.0248). In obese people, the OR for the metabolic syndrome in people with 3-4 times/d of coffee consumption v. <1 time/d was 0.68 (95% CI 0.50, 0.93), but >= 5 times/d of coffee consumption showed a non-significant positive association. Our findings suggest that moderate coffee consumption of 3-4 times/d is inversely associated with the metabolic syndrome in Korean adults. The association between heavy coffee consumption of >= 5 times/d and the metabolic syndrome varied by obesity status.

TI Long-Term Supplementation of Green Tea Extract Does Not Modify Adiposity
   or Bone Mineral Density in a Randomized Trial of Overweight and Obese
   Postmenopausal Women

AB Background: Green tea extract (GTE) consumption has been linked to favorable changes in adiposity and bone mineral density (BMD), although it is unknown if these effects are due to green tea catechins or caffeine. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COM7) genotype may also modify these associations.
   Objective: We examined the impact of decaffeinated GTE on body composition (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and obesity-associated hormones.
   Methods: The Minnesota Green Tea Trial was a 12-mo randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 937 postmenopausal women (aged 50-70 y) assigned to receive either GTE containing 843 mg (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate or placebo. This substudy was conducted in 121 overweight/obese participants [body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2))
   Results: There were no differences in changes in BMI (-0.13 +/- 0.11 compared with -0.05 +/- 0.11; P= 0.61), total fat mass (-0.30 +/- 0.16 compared with -0.12 +/- 0.15 kg; P = 0.40), percentage of body fat (-0.15% +/- 0.17% compared with -0.15% +/- 0.16%; P = 0.99), or BMD (-0.006 +/- 0.002 compared with -0.003 +/- 0.002 g/cm(2); P = 0.49) over 12 mo between women taking GTE (n = 61) and those taking a placebo (n = 60). Interactions were observed between treatment and time for gynoid percentage of fat (%fat) and tissue %fat. Gynoid %fat increased from baseline to month 12 in the placebo group as baseline BMI increased and decreased over time as baseline BMI increased in the GTE group (P-interaction = 0.02). Tissue %fat increased from baseline to month 12 in the placebo group as baseline BMI increased. In the GTE group, tissue %fat decreased during the intervention as baseline BMI increased (P-interaction = 0.04). No changes were seen in circulating leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, or insulin concentrations. COMT genotype did not modify the effect of GTE on any variable.
   Conclusions: Decaffeinated GTE was not associated with overall reductions in adiposity or improvements in BMD in overweight/obese postmenopausal women. However, GTE may be beneficial for reduction in tissue and gynoid %fat in individuals with higher BMI. This clinical trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00917735.

AB The objective of the study was to investigate associations between coffee consumption and the occurrence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components in individuals with a normal BMI, as well in those who are overweight and obese. The analysis was based on the data of 10,367 participants. The studies included a questionnaire interview, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure measurements and analyses of collected fasting-blood samples. In the overweight and obese participants, lower coffee consumption, compared with higher consumption was correlated with a significantly higher risk of abdominal obesity, hypertension, an abnormal glucose concentration, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and MetS (p<.05). In the participants with a normal BMI, lower coffee consumption was related to the abdominal obesity, HDL cholesterol and MetS (p<.05). Individuals with a normal BMI may react slightly differently to nutritional factors modifying metabolism such as coffee, compared with those with excessive body mass.

AB Objectives To study the association between maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and the child's weight gain and overweight risk up to 8 years.
   Design Prospective nationwide pregnancy cohort.
   Setting The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study.
   Participants A total of 50943 mothers recruited from 2002 to 2008 and their children, after singleton pregnancies, with information about average caffeine intake assessed at mid-pregnancy.
   Outcome measure Child's body size information at 11 age points from 6 weeks to 8 years. We defined excess growth in infancy as a WHO weight gain z-score of >0.67 from birth to age 1 year, and overweight according to the International Obesity Task Force. We used a growth model to assess individual growth trajectories.
   Results Compared with pregnant women with low caffeine intake (<50 mg/day, 46%), women with average (50-199 mg/day, 44 %), high (>= 200-299 mg/day, 7 %) and very high (>= 300 mg/day, 3%) caffeine intakes had an increased risk of their child experiencing excess growth in infancy, after adjustment for confounders (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.22, OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.45, OR=1.66, 95%CI 1.42 to 1.93, respectively). In utero exposure to any caffeine was associated with higher risk of overweight at age 3 years and 5 years, while the association persisted at 8 years, only for very high exposures. Any caffeine intake was associated with increased body mass index from infancy to childhood. Children prenatally exposed to caffeine intake >200 mg/day had consistently higher weight. Very High caffeine exposures were associated with higher weight gain velocity from infancy to age 8 years.
   Conclusion Any caffeine consumption during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of excess infant growth and of childhood overweight, mainly at preschool ages. Maternal caffeine intake may modify the overall weight growth trajectory of the child from birth to 8 years. This study adds supporting evidence for the current advice to reduce caffeine intake during pregnancy.

AB The present study investigated the potential of potato peel powders, high in bioactive phenolic compounds and glycoalkaloids, to reduce weight gain in mice consuming a high-fat diet. Potato peel powders were prepared from the following fresh commercial potato varieties by hand-peeling and then freeze-drying and grinding the peels into powder: non-organic (conventionally grown) gold, red, and Russet and organically grown Russet. Mice diets (25% fat by weight) were supplemented with either 10 or 20% potato peel powders for 3 weeks. In comparison to the control diet, the isocaloric and isonitrogenous peel containing diets induced a reduction in weight gain that ranged from 17-45% (10% peel diets) to 46-73% (20% peel diets), suggesting that differences in weight gain are associated with the potato peel source and peel concentration of the diet. Weight reductions were accompanied by reduced epididymal white adipose tissue ranging from 22 to 80% as well as changes in the microbiota analyzed using next-generation sequencing and in obesity-associated genetic biomarkers determined by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Safety aspects and possible mechanisms of the antiobesity effects are discussed in terms of the composition of the bioactive potato peel compounds, which were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results suggest that potato peels, a major peeling byproduct of potato processing used to prepare fries, chips, and potato flour, that showed exceptionally high antiobesity properties in fat mice, have the potential to serve as an antiobesity functional food.

AB Caffeinated beverages, most commonly tea and coffee, may have important effects on insulin regulation that may give their consumption an important role among nutritional factors in the development of diseases of glucose and insulin metabolism, such as diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular diseases. These beverages include compounds that may have contradictory effects on insulin and glucose: Caffeine impairs insulin sensitivity, but polyphenolic molecules within tea, coffee, and cocoa augment the effects of insulin. In addition, epidemiologic associations exist between greater consumption of such beverages and lower risk of diabetes. The beneficial effects of such beverages might be enhanced by changing the process of their preparation and substitution of other substances commonly added to caffeinated beverages that impair the effect of insulin, such as sugar or milk.

AB Coffee consumption has been associated with decreased mortality in previous studies. As aging, obesity, and lifestyle factors affect the risk of mortality, the association between coffee and mortality needs to be examined in various subpopulations by characteristics of subjects. To quantitatively assess this association, we conducted an updated meta-analysis including stratified analyses by potential modifiers. We searched in the PubMed and Web of Science databases through March 8, 2019, and conducted meta-analysis including linear and non-linear dose-response analyses. We identified 40 studies including 3,852,651 subjects and 450,256 all-cause and cause-specific deaths. Non-linear inverse associations between coffee consumption and mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancers were found. The lowest relative risk (RR) was at intakes of 3.5cups/day for all-cause mortality (RR=0.85, 95% CI 0.82-0.89), 2.5cups/day for CVD mortality (RR=0.83, 95% CI 0.80-0.87), and 2cups/day for cancer mortality (RR=0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.99), while additional intakes were not associated with further lower mortality. An inverse association between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality was maintained irrespective of age, overweight status, alcohol drinking, smoking status, and caffeine content of coffee. By region, Europe and Asia showed stronger inverse associations than US. A non-linear inverse association was found for mortality from respiratory disease and diabetes, while linear inverse association was found for mortality from non-CVD, non-cancer causes. Moderate coffee consumption (e.g. 2-4cups/day) was associated with reduced all-cause and cause-specific mortality, compared to no coffee consumption. The inverse association between coffee and all-cause mortality was consistent by potential modifiers except region.

AB The literature is inconsistent as to how coffee affects metabolic syndrome (MetS), and which bioactive compounds are responsible for its metabolic effects. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of unfiltered coffee on diet-induced MetS and investigate whether or not phenolic acids and trigonelline are the main bioactive compounds in coffee. Twenty-four male SpragueDawley rats were fed a high-fat (35% W/W) diet plus 20% W/W fructose in drinking water for 14 weeks, and were randomized into three groups: control, coffee, or nutraceuticals (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid, and trigonelline). Coffee or nutraceuticals were provided in drinking water at a dosage equal to 4 cups/day in a human. Compared to the controls, total food intake (p = 0.023) and mean body weight at endpoint (p = 0.016) and estimated average plasma glucose (p = 0.041) were lower only in the coffee group. Surrogate measures of insulin resistance including the overall fasting insulin (p = 0.010), endpoint HOMA-IR (p = 0.022), and oral glucose tolerance (p = 0.029) were improved in the coffee group. Circulating triglyceride levels were lower (p = 0.010), and histopathological and quantitative (p = 0.010) measurements indicated lower grades of liver steatosis compared to controls after long-term coffee consumption. In conclusion, a combination of phenolic acids and trigonelline was not as effective as coffee per se in improving the components of the MetS. This points to the role of other coffee chemicals and a potential synergism between compounds.

AB Background: We have previously shown that a combination of glucosyl hesperidin (G-hesperidin) plus caffeine reduces accumulation of body fat, whereas G-hesperidin or caffeine alone shows little effect on high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice. The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of G-hesperidin plus caffeine on body fat and serum TG in healthy subjects with moderately high body mass index (BMI) and serum TG. Since we considered that there are individual differences in caffeine sensitivity, we conducted dose-finding study of caffeine combined with G-hesperidin.
   Methods: Seventy-five healthy subjects with moderately high BMI (24-30 kg/m(2)) and serum TG (100-250 mg/dl) were divided and assigned to 12-week intervention with daily intakes of 500 mg of G-hesperidin with or without 25, 50, or 75 mg of caffeine, or placebo in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design.
   Results: After intervention, decreases in abdominal fat area (AFA), especially subcutaneous fat area (SFA), were significantly greater in the G-hesperidin with 50-mg caffeine group (AFA:-8.4 +/- 21.9 v. s. 16.3 +/- 34.1 cm(2); p < 0.05, SFA: -9.3 +/- 17.1 v.s. 11.2 +/- 18.3 cm(2); p < 0.01) and in the G-hesperidin with 75-mg caffeine group (AFA:-17.0 +/- 31.4 v.s. 16.3 +/- 34.1 cm(2); p < 0.01, SFA: -12.4 +/- 18.7 v. s. 11.2 +/- 18.3 cm(2); p < 0.01) than in the placebo group. Fat-decreasing effects of G-hesperidin were enhanced dose-dependently by caffeine addition. BMI decreases were significantly greater in the G-hesperidin with 75-mg caffeine group than in the placebo group (-0.56 +/- 0.74 v. s. -0.02 +/- 0.58 kg/m(2); p < 0.05). G-hesperidin with/without caffeine had no effect on serum TG (p > 0.05 v. s. placebo).
   Conclusions: These data suggested that a combination of 500-mg G-hesperidin with 50- or 75-mg caffeine may be useful for the prevention or treatment of obesity.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Association between the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and obesity is universally a controversial issue. This study was undertaken to examine the beverage consumption pattern of Korean adolescents.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data was collected from the 2016 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey involving 65,528 adolescent respondents. A list of the most frequently consumed beverages was analyzed, and the consumption frequency of carbonated beverages, SSBs, and energy drinks during the past seven-days was assessed. The main reasons for the adolescents to consume the beverages were also determined.
   RESULTS: The beverage preference of adolescents were carbonated beverages (31.0%), 'fruit and vegetable beverages (17.7%)', 'milk (13.6%)', and 'coffee (12.7%)'. Carbonated beverages and SSBs were consumed more than three times a week by 27.1% and 41.1% of the respondents, respectively. About 86.2% of adolescents did not take of any energy drinks during the last seven-days. Taste was the most common reason that adolescents considered when choosing a drink. Carbonated beverages consumed more frequently by boys than girls, and high school students drank coffee more frequently than middle school students.
   CONCLUSIONS: Boys had a higher preference for unhealthy beverages than girls, whereas consumption of high-caffeine drinks was greater amongst high-school students than middle school students.

ID PROFILE
AB Obesity and type II diabetes are serious health problems and are among the leading causes of death. There are a few prescription weight loss drugs, but they have a high cost and their adverse effects have limited their widespread use. For the consumer, the use of dietary supplements represents a natural and presumably safer means of losing weight. A high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to provide a simple, inexpensive method for analysis of 54 commercially available extracts of green coffee beans. Both chlorogenic acids (CGAs), which are the purported bioactives, and caffeine were measured using 5-chloroquinic acid as the standard and published extinction coefficients for the other monomeric and dimeric CGAs present. The average labeled dose of CGA was 233 mg, whereas the average calculated by HPLC analysis was only 157 mg. Thus, the consumer is likely to obtain product containing a little more than half of the reported label amount of CGA. Caffeine levels ranged from 0% to 17%. The marketing literature touts 50% CGA content as being the gold standard of green coffee bean extract products. Based on this value, only 28% of the commercial products we studied met this goal.

AB Phenolic acids have recently gained substantial attention due to their various practical, biological and pharmacological effects. Chlorogenic Acid (CGA, 3-CQA) is a most abundant isomer among caffeoylquinic acid isomers (3-, 4-, and 5-CQA), that currently known as 5-CQA as per guidelines of IUPAC. It is one of the most available acids among phenolic acid compounds which can be naturally found in green coffee extracts and tea. CGA is an important and biologically active dietary polyphenol, playing several important and therapeutic roles such as antioxidant activity, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, neuroprotective, anti-obesity, antiviral, anti-microbial, anti-hypertension, free radicals scavenger and a central nervous system (CNS) stimulator. In addition, it has been found that CGA could modulate lipid metabolism and glucose in both genetically and healthy metabolic related disorders. It is speculated that CGA can perform crucial roles in lipid and glucose metabolism regulation and thus help to treat many disorders such as hepatic steatosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity as well. Furthermore, this phenolic acid (CGA) causes hepatoprotective effects by protecting animals from chemical or lipopolysaccharide-induced injuries. The hypocholesterolemic influence of CGA can result from the altered metabolism of nutrients, including amino acids, glucose and fatty acids (FA). The purpose of this review was to broaden the scope of knowledge of researchers to conduct more studies on this subject to both unveil and optimize its biological and pharmacological effects. As a result, CGA may be practically used as a natural safeguard food additive to replace the synthetic antibiotics and thereby reduce the medicinal cost.

AB Chlorogenic acids (CGA) are the most abundant phenolic compounds in green coffee beans and in the human diet and have been suggested to mitigate several cardiometabolic risk factors. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effect of a water-based standardized green coffee extract (GCE) on cardiometabolic parameters in ApoE(-/-) mice and to explore the potential underlying mechanisms. Mice were fed an atherogenic diet without (vehicle) or with GCE by gavage (equivalent to 220 mg/kg of CGA) for 14 weeks. We assessed several metabolic, pathological, and inflammatory parameters and inferred gut microbiota composition, diversity, and functional potential. Although GCE did not reduce atherosclerotic lesion progression or plasma lipid levels, it induced important favorable changes. Specifically, improved metabolic parameters, including fasting glucose, insulin resistance, serum leptin, urinary catecholamines, and liver triglycerides, were observed. These changes were accompanied by reduced weight gain, decreased adiposity, lower inflammatory infiltrate in adipose tissue, and protection against liver damage. Interestingly, GCE also modulated hepatic IL-6 and total serum IgM and induced shifts in gut microbiota. Altogether, our results reveal the cooccurrence of these beneficial cardiometabolic effects in response to GCE in the same experimental model and suggest potential mediators and pathways involved.

AB Backgrounds and Aims: Insulin resistance is a common feature of metabolic syndrome that may be influenced by genetic risk factors. We hypothesized that genetic risk scores (GRS) of SNPs that influence insulin resistance and signaling interact with lifestyles to modulate insulin resistance in Korean adults.
   Methods and results: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of subjects aged 40-65 years who participated in the Ansung/Ansan cohorts (8842 adults) in Korea revealed 52 genetic variants that influence insulin resistance. The best gene-gene interaction model was explored using the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method. GRS from the best model were calculated and the GRS were divided into low, medium and high groups. The best model for representing insulin resistance included SLIT3_rs2974430, PLEKHA5_rs1077044, and PPP2R2C_rs16838853. The odds ratios for insulin resistance were increased by 150% in the High-GRS group compared to the Low-GRS group. However, ORs for insulin secretion capacity, measured by HOMA-B, were not associated with GRS. Coffee and caffeine intake and GRS had an interaction with insulin resistance: In subjects with high coffee (>= 10 cups/week) or caffeine intake (>= 220 mg caffeine/day), insulin resistance was significantly elevated in the High-GRS group, but not in the Low-GRS. However, alcohol intake, smoking and physical activity did not have an interaction with GRS. Insulin secretion capacity was not significantly influenced by GRS when evaluating the adjusted odds ratios.
   Conclusions: Subjects with High-GRS may be susceptible to increased insulin resistance by 50% and its risk may be exacerbated by consuming more than 10 cups coffee/week or 220 mg caffeine/day.

AB This 60-day, 30-subject pilot study examined a novel combination of ingredients in a unique sustained release (Carbopol matrix) tablet consumed twice daily. The product was composed of extracts of banaba leaf, green coffee bean, and Moringa oleifera leaf and vitamin D3. Safety was assessed using a 45-measurement blood chemistry panel, an 86-item self-reported Quality of Life Inventory, bone mineral density, and cardiovascular changes. Efficacy was assessed by calculating a body composition improvement index (BCI) based on changes in dual energy X-ray absorptiometry measured fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) as well as between the study group (SG) and a historical placebo group. No changes occurred in any blood chemistry measurements. Positive changes were found in the Quality of Life (QOL) inventory composite scores. No adverse effects were observed. Decreases occurred in FM (p=0.004) and increases in FFM (p=0.009). Relative to the historical placebo group, the SG lost more FM (p<0.0001), gained more FFM (p=<0.0001), and had a negative BCI of -2.7lb. compared with a positive BCI in the SG of 3.4lb., a 6.1 discordance (p=0.0009). The data support the safety and efficacy of this unique product and demonstrate importance of using changes in body composition versus scale weight and BMI.

AB Chlorogenic acid as a natural hydroxycinnamic acid has protective effect for liver. Endotoxin induced metabolic disorder, such as lipid dysregulation and hyperlipidemia. In this study, we investigated the effect of chlorogenic acid in rats with chronic endotoxin infusion. The Sprague-Dawley rats with lipid metabolic disorder (LD group) were intraperitoneally injected endotoxin. And the rats of chlorogenic acid-LD group were daily received chlorogenic acid by intragastric administration. In chlorogenic acid-LD group, the area of visceral adipocyte was decreased and liver injury was ameliorated, as compared to LD group. In chlorogenic acid-LD group, serum triglycerides, free fatty acids, hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol were decreased, the proportion of C20:1, C24:1 and C18:3n-6, Delta 9-18 and Delta 6-desaturase activity index in the liver Were decreased, and the proportion of C18:3n-3 acid was increased, compared to the LD group. Moreover, levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I, and fatty acid beta-oxidation were increased in chlorogenic acid-LD group compared to LD rats, whereas levels of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase were decreased. These findings demonstrate that chlorogenic acid effectively improves hepatic lipid dysregulation in rats by regulating fatty acid metabolism enzymes, stimulating AMP-activated protein kinase activation, and modulating levels of hepatic fatty acids.

AB This study investigated the effect of coffee pulp aqueous extract (CPE) on obesity- induced hepatic steatosis in rats and the mechanism involved. Male Wistar rats were fed high-fat diet for 12 weeks and supplemented with 1000 mg/kg BW CPE or 40 mg/kg BW simvastatin or CPE combined with 20 mg/kg BW simvastatin for another 12 weeks. The lipid profiles, presence of insulin resistance, development of hepatic steatosis and related mechanisms were investigated. Results show that CPE, simvastatin and combined treatment improved lipid profiles, insulin resistance, oxidative stress and hepatic steatosis. Correspondingly, CPE induced the lipolytic gene PPAR alpha, while combination treatment additively suppressed the lipogenic genes PPAR gamma and SREBP1-c. Such effects downregulated the fatty acid transporter FAT/CD36, and activated AMPK, which concomitantly improved obese induced-hepatic steatosis. Collectively, hepato-protective effects of CPE, particularly combined with simvastatin, could broaden the therapeutic options for hyperlipidaemia and NAFLD patients who receive lipid-lowering drugs.

AB Objective: The association of caffeine intake with testosterone remains unclear. We evaluated the association of caffeine intake with serum testosterone among American men and determined whether this association varied by race/ethnicity and measurements of adiposity. Methods: Data were analyzed for 2581 men (>= 20 years old) who participated in the cycles of the NHANES 1999-2004 and 2011-2012, a cross-sectional study. Testosterone (ng/mL) was measured by immunoassay among men who participated in the morning examination session. We analyzed 24-h dietary recall data to estimate caffeine intake (mg/day). Multivariable weighted linear regression models were conducted. Results: We identified no linear relationship between caffeine intake and testosterone levels in the total population, but there was a non-linear association (p(nonlinearity) < .01). Similarly, stratified analysis showed nonlinear associations among Mexican-American and Non-Hispanic White men (p(nonlinearity) <= .03 both) and only among men with waist circumference <102 cm and body mass index <25 kg/m(2) (p(nonlinearity) < .01, both). Conclusion: No linear association was identified between levels of caffeine intake and testosterone in US men, but we observed a non-linear association, including among racial/ethnic groups and measurements of adiposity in this cross-sectional study. These associations are warranted to be investigated in larger prospective studies.

AB Background: Caffeine, the main component of coffee, has showed its protective effect on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in many studies. However, the hepatoprotection of caffeine and its mechanisms in zebrafish were unexplored. Thus, this study's intentions are to establish a NAFLD model of zebrafish larvae and to examine the role of caffeine on fatty liver with the model.
   Results: Growth and the incidence of fatty liver of zebrafish larvae increased with the increased amount of feeding in a dose-dependent manner. The degree of hepatic steatosis of larvae also gradually aggravated with the increased quantity and duration of feeding. Triglyceride contents of zebrafish fed for 20 days significantly increased in model group (180 mg/d) compared with control group (30 mg/d) (P < 0.001). Significant decreases in body weight and hepatic steatosis rate were observed in 2.5, 5, 8 % caffeine treatment group compared with model group (P < 0.05). Hepatic lipid accumulation was also significantly reduced in caffeine treatment larvae. Moreover, caffeine treatment was associated with upregulation of lipid beta-oxidation gene ACO and downregulation of lipogenesis-associated genes (SREBP1, ACC1, CD36 and UCP2), ER stress-associated genes (PERK, IRE1, ATF6 and BIP), the inflammatory cytokine genes (IL-1beta and TNF alpha) and autophagy associated genes (ATG12 and Beclin 1). Protein expression of CHOP, BIP and IL-1beta remarkably reduced in caffeine treatment group compared with model group.
   Conclusions: We induced hepatoteatosis in zebrafish by overfeeding regimen and demonstrated caffeine have a role in suppression of hepatosteatosis by downregulation of genes associated with lipogenesis, ER stress, inflammatory response and enhancement of lipid oxidation, indicating zebrafish model may be used to identify putative pharmacological targets and to test novel drugs for human NAFLD treatment.

AB To develop an anti-obesity agent, we examined the combination effect of glucosyl hesperidin (G-hesperidin) and caffeine on obesity in mice. High-fat diet-induced obese KK mice were fed a low-fat diet with or without G-hesperidin, caffeine, or their combination for 2weeks. Decreases in body weight and significantly lower adipose tissue weight were observed in the combination-fed mice but not in the G-hesperidin-fed or caffeine-fed mice. DNA microarray analysis of mouse liver suggested that the feeding of G-hesperidin+caffeine was associated with lower lipogenesis. Therefore, we examined the anti-lipogenic effect of G-hesperidin+caffeine in fasted-refed KK mice. Hepatic triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the mice fed G-hesperidin+caffeine during the refeeding period but not in the mice fed each alone. In addition, hepatic expressions of genes related to lipogenesis, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c or fatty acid synthase, were significantly lower in the mice fed G-hesperidin+caffeine compared with that in the control mice. These results suggested that G-hesperidin+caffeine is effective for controlling obesity partly by the inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Substantial evidence is emerging on the coexistence of double burden of malnutrition on adolescents of low-income countries, shaping the health challenges of the upcoming adult generation for the worst. Whether nutritional status markers of adolescents in the cash crop setting are on par with economic gains remains uncertain. Thus, we investigated the nutritional outcomes of adolescents and their determinants in coffee farming households.
   Methods: The survey was carried out in 3 top coffee-producing districts of Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. Five hundred fifty mothers/caregivers and their respective adolescents were selected using multistage random sampling. Anthropometric data were converted into height-for-age and body-mass-index-for-age Z scores using WHO Anthroplus software and analyzed by SPSS for windows.
   Results: Prevalence of thinness, stunting, and overweight/obesity were 11.6%, 15.6%, and 7.1%, respectively. The odds of stunting among adolescents in households in the lowest wealth tertile was nearly 6-fold higher compared to the highest tertile (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.6 [2.6-12]). Conversely, the odds of overweight/obesity was higher among adolescents in the households in the middle wealth tertile (AOR = 2.72 [1.08-6.86]) compared to the highest tertile. Adolescents living in households with low-dependent age-groups were more than twice likely to be overweight/obese (AOR = 2.58 [1.06-6.24]).
   Conclusion: The current study revealed the presence of substantial dual burden of malnutrition. In such a setting, it is critical to draw a fine line and trade-off for eliminating morbidity and mortality of undernutrition, without triggering the risk of overweight/obesity.

AB Background: Whether habitual coffee consumption interacts with the genetic predisposition to obesity in relation to body mass index (BMI) and obesity is unknown.
   Methods: We analyzed the interactions between genetic predisposition and habitual coffee consumption in relation to BMI and obesity risk in 5116 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), in 9841 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), and in 5648 women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). The genetic risk score was calculated based on 77 BMI-associated loci. Coffee consumption was examined prospectively in relation to BMI.
   Results: The genetic association with BMI was attenuated among participants with higher consumption of coffee than among those with lower consumption in the HPFS (P-interaction = 0.023) and NHS (P-interaction = 0.039); similar results were replicated in the WHI (P-interaction = 0.044). In the combined data of all cohorts, differences in BMI per increment of 10-risk allele were 1.38 (standard error (SE), 0.28), 1.02 (SE, 0.10), and 0.95 (SE, 0.12) kg/m(2) for coffee consumption of < 1, 1-3 and > 3 cup(s)/day, respectively (P-interaction < 0.001). Such interaction was partly due to slightly higher BMI with higher coffee consumption among participants at lower genetic risk and slightly lower BMI with higher coffee consumption among those at higher genetic risk. Each increment of 10-risk allele was associated with 78% (95% confidence interval (CI), 59-99%), 48% (95% CI, 36-62%), and 43% (95% CI, 28-59%) increased risk for obesity across these subgroups of coffee consumption (P-interaction = 0.008). From another perspective, differences in BMI per increment of 1 cup/day coffee consumption were 0.02 (SE, 0.09), -0.02 (SE, 0.04), and -0.14 (SE, 0.04) kg/m(2) across tertiles of the genetic risk score.
   Conclusions: Higher coffee consumption might attenuate the genetic associations with BMI and obesity risk, and individuals with greater genetic predisposition to obesity appeared to have lower BMI associated with higher coffee consumption.

AB Background: Given that the most recent systematic review investigating Green-Coffee Extract (GCE) as a weight loss facilitator was nearly a decade ago and that the authors reported there no consensus on the effect of GCE/CGA (Chlorogenic acids) on body composition indices, a comprehensive systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of all available randomized controlled trial (RCTs) was undertaken to examine the effect of GCE and CGA intervention on body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in adults.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search of all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed up to June 2019 in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar. RCTs that investigated the effect GCE/CGA Supplementation on BW, BMI and WC in adults were included for final analysis. The pooled weight mean difference (WMD) of included studies was estimated using a random-effects model.
   Results: A total of 13 articles with 16 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Results revealed significant reduction in BMI (WMD: - 0.403 kg/m(2), 95% CI: - 0.800, - 0.005, p = 0.047) and no significant change in BW (WMD: - 0.585 kg, 95% CI: - 1.498, 0.329, p = 0.210) and WC (WMD: - 0.847 cm, 95% CI: - 1.764, 0.071, p = 0.070). In the subgroup analysis, studies that were conducted on baseline BMI >= 25 kg/m(2) revealed a significant greater reduction in body weight and BMI than those performed on baseline BMI <25 kg/m(2). Moreover, short supplementation periods of less than 4 weeks had no effect.
   Conclusion: The results of current meta-analysis study support the use of GCE supplementation for the improvement of obesity indices, with sub-group analysis highlighting greater improvements in individuals with a starting BMI >= 25 kg/m(2).

AB Including carbohydrate/fructose-rich foods (predominantly fruit) in the diets of overweight individuals can improve chronic disease risk factors. We hypothesized dried plums (DP) would improve nutrient consumption, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), lipid and adipokine profiles, and would decrease adiposity and inflammation. To test this, we studied the effects of 8-weeks of twice-daily snacking of macronutrient-matched 100 kcal servings of DP or refined carbohydrate-rich snack (low-fat muffins: LFM) on daily energy and nutrient consumption, and chronic disease risk factors in overweight adults. Body weight/composition, waist circumference, blood pressure, plasma glucose, insulin, c-peptide, lipids, TAC, adipokines and inflammation were measured at baseline and throughout the study. Postprandial glucose and insulin were assessed following assigned test foods at baseline and 8-weeks. Repeated measures ANOVAs were undertaken to examine group and time differences. Post-hoc independent and paired samples t-tests were conducted where necessary. DP increased (P < .05) overall intake of dietary fiber and potassium, and TAC, from baseline to 8-weeks. Baseline postprandial glycemia tended (P = .09) to be lower with DP versus LFM, while both groups had a decreased response after 8-weeks. Postprandial insulinemia was lower (P < .05) for DP at both time-points. No differences in body weight/composition, blood pressure, or fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, inflammation or adipokines were detected. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) increased (P < .05) throughout the trial following LFM. Overall, DP lessened postprandial insulinemia, improved nutrient consumption and plasma TAC, and maintained plasma LDL-C compared to a macronutrient-matched refined carbohydrate snack, which could decrease chronic disease risk.

AB Atherosclerosis is one of the diseases related to metabolic syndrome which is caused by obesity. Previous reports have shown that green tea and its components have anti-obesity effect. We examined whether catechins and caffeine can prevent the development of atherosclerosis by oral administration, singly or in combination to the atherosclerosis model mice. Results demonstrated that the number of atherosclerotic regions in the aorta was significantly reduced by the combined treatment, and the atherosclerotic area was also improved. Serum HDL-C increased by caffeine single treatment, but no effect on the TG and TC by any treatments. Moreover, ECG illuviated to atheromatous lesions in aorta and the illuviation was enhanced by caffeine. The mRNA expression levels of LOX-1 and TNF-alpha showed a tendency to suppress by the combined treatment. These results indicated that the combined administration of catechins and caffeine has the inhibitory effect on the development of atherosclerosis in mice.

AB Objectives To examine the association between coffee, including caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and assess the influence of HCC aetiology and pre-existing liver disease.
   Design We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We calculated relative risks (RRs) of HCC according to caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption using a random-effects dose-response meta-analysis. We tested for modification of the effect estimate by HCC aetiology and pre-existing liver disease. We judged the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.
   Results We found 18 cohorts, involving 2 272 642 participants and 2905 cases, and 8 case-control studies, involving 1825 cases and 4652 controls. An extra two cups per day of coffee was associated with a 35% reduction in the risk of HCC (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.72). The inverse association was weaker for cohorts (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.77), which were generally of higher quality than case-control studies (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.69). There was evidence that the association was not significantly altered by stage of liver disease or the presence/absence of high alcohol consumption, high body mass index, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, or hepatitis B and C viruses. An extra two cups of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee (2 and 3 cohort studies, respectively) were associated with reductions of 27% (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85) and 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.00) in the risk of HCC. However, due to a lack of randomised controlled trials, potential publication bias and there being no accepted definition of coffee, the quality of evidence under the GRADE criteria was 'very low'.
   Conclusions Increased consumption of caffeinated coffee and, to a lesser extent, decaffeinated coffee are associated with reduced risk of HCC, including in pre-existing liver disease. These findings are important given the increasing incidence of HCC globally and its poor prognosis.

AB In obesity, there are no effective therapies for parallel immune and metabolic abnormalities, including systemic/tissue insulin-resistance/ inflammation, adiposity and hepatic steatosis. Caffeine has anti-inflammation, antihepatic steatosis, and anti-insulin resistance effects. In this study, we evaluated the effects and molecular mechanisms of 6 wk of caffeine treatment (HFD-caf) on immunological and metabolic abnormalities of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats. Compared with HFD vehicle (HFD-V) rats, in HFD-caf rats the suppressed circulating immune cell inflammatory [TNF alpha, MCP-1, IL-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and nitrite] profiles were accompanied by decreased liver, white adipose tissue (WAT), and muscle macrophages and their intracellular cytokine levels. Metabolically, the increase in metabolic rates reduced lipid accumulation in various tissues, resulting in reduced adiposity, lower fat mass, decreased body weight, amelioration of hepatic steatosis, and improved systemic/muscle insulin resistance. Further mechanistic approaches revealed an upregulation of tissue lipogenic [(SREBPlc, fatty acid synthase. acetyl-CoA carboxylase)/insulin-sensitizing (GLUT4 and p-IRSl)] markers in HFD-caf rats. Significantly, ex vivo experiments revealed that the cytokine release by the cocultured peripheral blood mononuclear cell (monocyte) and WAT (adipocyte), which are known to stimulate macrophage migration and hepatocyte lipogenesis, were lower in HFD-V groups than HFD-caf groups. Caffeine treatment simultaneously ameliorates immune and metabolic pathogenic signals present in tissue to normalize immunolgical and metabolic abnormalities found in HFD-induced obese rats.

AB Few studies have examined the effects of coffee on body composition in the general population. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that coffee consumption is protective against obesity and sarcopenia in Korean adults. The study included 6906 subjects aged >= 40 years who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2009-2010. Body composition was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and obesity was determined according to the body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). Sarcopenia was defined as an appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by height-squared that was below the lower quintile of the study population. Participants were classified into 4 groups according to the degree of coffee consumption (<1/d, 1/d, 2/d, and >= 3/d).The numbers of participants who were obese by BMI, obese by WC, and sarcopenic were 2390 (35.5%), 2033 (28.5%), and 1438 (20.0%), respectively. On multiple logistic regression analyses, the odds ratio (OR) of sarcopenia was lower in men who drink coffee once a day compared to those who rarely drink coffee (OR: 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50-0.94). Women who consumed coffee >= 3 times/d had higher obesity ORs than those who rarely drink coffee according to both obesity indices (OR: 1.57, 95% CI, 1.18-2.10 for obesity by BMI; OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75 for obesity by WC). Light coffee consumption was protective against sarcopenia in men, whereas frequent coffee consumption produced a higher risk for obesity, especially in women. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Plant-based diets rich in bioactive compounds such as polyphenols have been shown to positively modulate the risk of cardiometabolic (CM) diseases. The inter-individual variability in the response to these bioactives may affect the findings. This systematic review aimed to summarize findings from existing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) on markers of CM health in humans. Literature searches were performed in PubMed and the Web of Science. RCTs on acute and chronic supplementation of HCA-rich foods/extracts on CM biomarkers were included. Forty-four RCTs (21 acute and 23 chronic) met inclusion criteria. Comparisons were made between RCTs, including assessments based on population health status. Of the 44 RCTs, only seven performed analyses on a factor exploring inter-individual response to HCA consumption. Results demonstrated that health status is a potentially important effect modifier as RCTs with higher baseline cholesterol, blood pressure and glycaemia demonstrated greater overall effectiveness, which was also found in studies where specific subgroup analyses were performed. Thus, the effect of HCAs on CM risk factors may be greater in individuals at higher CM risk, although future studies in these populations are needed, including those on other potential determinants of inter-individual variability.

AB The components of roasted or green coffee beans that promote abdominal fat reduction are not clear. We investigated the effects of daily consumption of coffee enriched in chlorogenic acids (CGA) on abdominal fat area in a randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled trial. Healthy, overweight men and women (n = 150, body mass index (BMI) >= 25 to <30 kg/m(2)) were randomly allocated to high-CGA (369 mg CGA/serving) or control (35 mg CGA/serving) coffee groups. Instant coffee was consumed once daily for 12 weeks, with four-week pre- and post-observation periods. Abdominal fat area and anthropometric measurements were analyzed at baseline and at four, eight, and 12 weeks, and 142 subjects completed the trial. Visceral fat area (VFA), total abdominal fat area (TFA), body weight, and waist circumference significantly decreased in the CGA group compared with the control group, with a group x time interaction (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.025, and p = 0.001, respectively). Changes in VFA and TFA from baseline to 12 weeks were significantly greater in the CGA group than in the control group (-9.0 +/- 13.9 cm(2) vs. -1.0 +/- 14.3 cm(2), p < 0.001; -13.8 +/- 22.9 cm(2) vs. -2.0 +/- 16.2 cm(2), p < 0.001). No severe adverse events occurred. Consumption of high-CGA coffee for 12 weeks by overweight adults might lower VFA, TFA, BMI, and waist circumference.

AB Objective
   The association between screen time and dietary patterns and overweight/obesity among adolescents was analysed in this study.
   Methods
   In this cross- sectional study, 963 Brazilian adolescents, aged between 11 and 14 years were evaluated. Body mass index was used to assess overweight/obesity. Dietary patterns and screen time were assessed using qualitative questionnaires. Principal component analysis was used to obtain dietary patterns. Confounder variables were: type of school (public or private), sexual maturation, mother's weight and mother's education. The Chi- square test was used for the crude analysis; for the adjusted analysis was used Poisson regression with sample weighting.
   Results
   Overweight/obesity prevalence was 29.8% and statistically higher among boys (34.7%). Higher screen time prevalence was 39.1%. The dietary patterns obtained were: obesogenic; coffee and dairy products; traditional Brazilian meal; fruit and vegetables; bread and chocolate milk. The dietary pattern that more closely represented student food consumption was the obesogenic pattern. Screen time was not significantly associated with overweight/obesity. The obesogenic pattern (in both sexes), the coffee and dairy products pattern, and the bread and chocolate milk pattern (only in girls), were inversely associated with overweight/obesity. In this study, dietary patterns influenced overweight/obesity, although in some cases, in an inverse way from what expected.
   Conclusion
   A high prevalence of overweight/obesity and a high proportion of screen time activities among the adolescents were observed. Our results indicate a high consumption of unhealthy dietary pattern among adolescents.

AB Objective: To evaluate possible lipid catabolism and body fat regulation effects of 3-caffeoylquinic acid in Green coffee bean extract (GCBE) in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Methods: Obesity was induced in mice using a HFD for four weeks. Then, mice were fed only HFD or HFD with GCBE at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg. Fatty acid synthesis mechanism regulation of body fat was investigated through real-time PCR and Western blot assay. Body fat reduction was measured through dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: In HFD-induced obese mice, GCBE treatment significantly decreased body weight gain, liver weight and white adipose tissue weights with regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis hormones, like adiponectin and leptin. GCBE treatment decreased mRNA expression levels of adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism related genes in adipose tissues and the liver, and decreased the corresponding protein expression. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements were used to compare body fat between mice on high-fat and those treated with GCBE. GCBE treated mice had a lower fat mass compared to HFD alone fed mice and relative body weight and fat mass were markedly decreased. Conclusions: GCBE has a potential anti-obesity effect with lowering body fat accumulation by regulating adipogenesis and lipid metabolism-related genes and proteins in WAT and liver.

AB Aims/hypothesis This study aimed to evaluate the association of types of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) (soft drinks, sweetened-milk beverages, sweetened tea/coffee), artificially sweetened beverages (ASB) and fruit juice with incident type 2 diabetes and determine the effects of substituting non-SSB for SSB and the population-attributable fraction of type 2 diabetes due to total sweet beverages.
   Methods Beverage consumption of 25,639 UK-resident adults without diabetes at baseline (1993-1997) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk study was assessed using 7-day food diaries. During 10.8 years of follow-up 847 incident type 2 diabetes cases were verified.
   Results In adjusted Cox regression analyses there were positive associations (HR [95% CI] per serving/day]) for soft drinks 1.21 (1.05, 1.39), sweetened-milk beverages 1.22 (1.05, 1.43) and ASB 1.22 (1.11, 1.33), but not for sweetened tea/coffee 0.98 (0.94, 1.02) or fruit juice 1.01 (0.88, 1.15). Further adjustment for adiposity attenuated the association of ASB, HR 1.06 (0.93, 1.20). There was a positive dose-response relationship with total sweet beverages: HR per 5% energy 1.18 (1.11, 1.26). Substituting ASB for any SSB did not reduce the incidence in analyses accounting for energy intake and adiposity. Substituting one serving/day of water or unsweetened tea/coffee for soft drinks and for sweetened-milk beverages reduced the incidence by 14%-25%. If sweet beverage consumers reduced intake to below 2% energy, 15% of incident diabetes might be prevented.
   Conclusions/interpretation The consumption of soft drinks, sweetened-milk beverages and energy from total sweet beverages was associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk independently of adiposity. Water or unsweetened tea/coffee appear to be suitable alternatives to SSB for diabetes prevention. These findings support the implementation of population-based interventions to reduce SSB consumption and increase the consumption of suitable alternatives.

AB Background: Although coffee consumption is increasing rapidly, the results of previous studies regarding the association between coffee consumption and stroke risk have been conflicting. This was a multi-center cross-sectional study that aimed to evaluate the relationship between coffee consumption and stroke risk in Korean population.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the Health Examinees (HEXA) Study, which involved 146,830 individuals aged 40-69 years. Coffee consumption was categorized as none, < 1 cup/day, 1 to < 3 cups/day, and >= 3 cups/day. We used logistic regression models to examine the association between coffee consumption and the risk of stroke while controlling for potential confounders and performed subgroup analyses.
   Results: After adjusting for age and various possible confounders, high coffee consumption was associated with a 38% lower odds ratio for stroke in women (none vs. >= 3 cups/day: OR, 0.62; 95% CI 0.47-0.81; P for trend < 0.0001). No significant association was found in men (none vs. >= 3 cups/day: OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.66-1.07; P for trend = 0.1515). In analyses stratified by covariates, an inverse association between coffee consumption and stroke risk was most evident among healthy women who were younger, non-obese, non-hypertensive, non-diabetic, non-smokers, and non-alcohol drinkers.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that higher coffee consumption may have protective benefits with regards to stroke risk in middle-aged Korean women.

AB BackgroundCoffee drinking has been implicated in mortality and a variety of diseases but potential mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear. Large-scale systems epidemiological approaches may offer novel insights to mechanisms underlying associations of coffee with health.
   ObjectiveWe performed an analysis of known and novel protein markers linked to cardiovascular disease and their association with habitual coffee intake in the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS, n = 816) and followed up top proteins in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM, n = 635) and EpiHealth (n = 2418).
   MethodsIn PIVUS and ULSAM, coffee intake was measured by 7-day dietary records whilst a computer-based food frequency questionnaire was used in EpiHealth. Levels of up to 80 proteins were assessed in plasma by a proximity extension assay.
   ResultsFour protein-coffee associations adjusted for age, sex, smoking and BMI, met statistical significance in PIVUS (FDR < 5%, P < 2.31 x 10(-3)): leptin (LEP), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 6 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. The inverse association between coffee intake and LEP replicated in ULSAM (, -0.042 SD per cup of coffee, P = 0.028) and EpiHealth (, -0.025 SD per time of coffee, P = 0.004). The negative coffee-CHI3L association replicated in EpiHealth (, -0.07, P = 1.15 x 10(-7)), but not in ULSAM (, -0.034, P = 0.16).
   ConclusionsThe current study supports an inverse association between coffee intake and plasma LEP and CHI3L1 levels. The coffee-CHI3L1 association is novel and warrants further investigation given links between CHI3L1 and health conditions that are also potentially influenced by coffee.

AB Instant coffee mixes that contain sugar and non-dairy creamer account for 80-90% of the total coffee market in Korea. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between coffee consumption and obesity in Korean women. We included 5995 women who participated in a health screening examination at the Korean National Cancer Center between 2007 and 2016. Daily coffee consumption and the use of sugar and creamer in coffee was evaluated using a 106-item food frequency questionnaire. Obesity was assessed by body mass index (BMI), and abdominal obesity was assessed by waist circumference (WC). A multiple logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of obesity according to coffee consumption. After multivariate adjustment, high coffee consumption was positively associated with obesity as measured by BMI (3 cups vs. no drinks, OR = 2.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.91-3.34; p for the trend < 0.001) and abdominal obesity as measured by WC (3 cups vs. no drinks, OR = 2.11; 95% CI = 1.59-2.79; p for the trend < 0.001). The positive association between daily coffee consumption and obesity prevalence was not altered by menopause. The amount of coffee with additives consumed per day by Korean women was positively correlated with the prevalence of obesity, but causation cannot be determined due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. The mechanism underlying the observed relationship is yet to be elucidated.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory potential of aqueous extracts from coffee silverskin (CSE) and husk (CHE) and their main phenolics on adipogenesis, obesity-related inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance, in vitro. Coffee by-products extracts (31-500 mu g mL(-1)) and pure phenolics (100 mu mol L-1 ) reduced lipid accumulation and increased mitochondrial activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Also reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and diminished secretion of proinflammatory factors in LPS-stimulated RAW2643.7 macrophages. Cytokine release diminished (tumor necrosis factor alpha: 23-57%; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1: 42-60%; interleukin-6: 30-39%) and adiponectin increased (7-13- fold) in adipocytes treated with macrophage-conditioned media. ROS scavenging and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha pathway counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction. Increases in insulin receptor (1.4 to 4-fold), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (2 to 3-fold) and protein kinase B (1.3 to 3-fold) phosphorylation, in conjunction with a decrease in serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, evoked glucose transporter 4 translocation (8-15-fold) and glucose uptake (44-85%). CSE and CHE phenolics inhibited adipogenesis and elicited adipocytes browning. Suppressing macrophages-adipocytes interaction alleviated inflammation-triggered mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. CSE and CHE are beneficial in reducing adipogenesis and inflammation-related disorders.

AB High sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption has been linked with obesity. The present study examined the associations between adolescent SSB intake and body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and overweight status in early adulthood, and modelled the association of alternative beverage substitution with BMI and WC. Data of offspring from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study at ages 14 and 22 years were used (n = 667). SSB intake at 14 years (100 g/day) was associated with higher BMI (beta = 0.19 kg/m(2), 95% CI 0.04, 0.33), WC (beta = 0.41cm, 95% CI 0.04, 0.78), and being overweight at 22 years (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02, 1.18). Every 100g modelled substitution of SSB with milk at age 14 years was associated with lower BMI (-0.19 kg/m(2)) and WC (-0.52 cm) at age 22 years. Replacement of SSB with diet drink was associated with higher BMI and WC. No association was found for substitutions of SSB with water, tea/coffee, or 100% fruit juice with BMI or WC. SSB intake during adolescence was associated with higher BMI, WC, and being overweight in early adulthood. Milk as an alternative to SSB was associated with less adiposity. Caution is necessary in recommending diet drinks as a SSB alternative.

AB Caffeine is a methylxanthine derived from plant foods such as coffee beans and tea leaves, and has multiple biological activities against physiological response and several diseases. Although there are some reports about the direct effect of caffeine against anti-lipid accumulation in vitro, the effect of caffeine on lipid accumulation in adipocytes through stimulating intestinal epithelial cells is unknown. Since direct treatment with caffeine to 3T3-L1 cells did not affect lipid accumulation, we determined whether caffeine-stimulated intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells influence the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Caco-2 cells were cultured on a transwell insert with or without caffeine for 24 h. Subsequently, the basolateral component of the Caco-2 cell culture on the transwell was collected and termed caffeine-conditioning medium (CCM). When 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with CCM, CCM decreased lipid accumulation and suppressed gene expression of proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) alpha in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, CCM decreased the expression of C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta at the protein level, but not at the mRNA level. We observed that a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, inhibited CCM-caused down-expression of C/EBP delta and C/EBP delta proteins, and that CCM promoted the ubiquitination level of C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta proteins. Protein microarray analysis showed caffeine suppresses the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-8 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 from Caco-2 cells. These results suggest that caffeine indirectly suppresses lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through decreasing secretion of inflammatory cytokines from Caco-2 cells.

AB Tea has been reported to prevent and manage many chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases, and the antioxidant capacity of tea may be responsible for these health benefits. In this study, the antioxidant capacities of fat-soluble, water-soluble, and bound-insoluble fractions of 30 Chinese teas belonging to six categories, namely green, black, oolong, dark, white, and yellow teas, were systematically evaluated, applying ferric-reducing antioxidant power and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assays. In addition, total phenolic contents of teas were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method, and the contents of 18 main phytochemical compounds in teas were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results found that several teas possessed very strong antioxidant capacity, and caffeine, theaflavine, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, as well as eight catechins, were the main antioxidant compounds in them. Thus, these teas could be good natural sources of dietary antioxidants, and their extracts might be developed as food additives, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.

AB Potatoes have shown promising health-promoting properties in human cell culture, experimental animal and human clinical studies, including antioxidant, hypocholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, antiobesity, anticancer and antidiabetic effects. Compounds present such as phenolics, fiber, starch and proteins as well as compounds considered antinutritional such as glycoalkaloids, lectins and proteinase inhibitors are believed to contribute to the health benefits of potatoes. However, epidemiological studies exploring the role of potatoes in human health have been inconclusive. Some studies support a protective effect of potato consumption in weight management and diabetes, while other studies demonstrate no effect and a few suggest a negative effect. As there are many biological activities attributed to the compounds present in potato, some of which could be beneficial or detrimental depending on specific circumstances, a long-term study investigating the association between potato consumption and diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and cancer while controlling for fat intake is needed.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate whether daily consumption of coffee and tea was associated with components and prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the Polish arm of the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe cohort study.
   A cross-sectional population-based survey including 8,821 adults (51.4 % female) was conducted in Krakow, Poland. Coffee and tea consumption was evaluated using food frequency questionnaires. MetS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation definition. Linear and logistic regression models were performed to estimate odds ratios and confidence intervals.
   Among high coffee and tea consumers (3 or more cups/day), high prevalence of female gender, young age, medium-high educational and occupational level, high total energy intake, and smoking habit were found. High coffee drinkers had lower BMI, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and higher HDL cholesterol than those drinking less than 1 cup/day. In contrast, high tea consumers had lower BMI, waist circumference, but not diastolic blood pressure, which was higher than low drinkers. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, both higher coffee and tea consumption were negatively associated with MetS (OR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.66, 0.86 and OR 0.79, 95 % CI 0.67, 0.92, respectively). Among specific components of MetS, high coffee consumption was negatively associated with waist circumference, hypertension, and triglycerides, whereas tea consumption with central obesity and fasting plasma glucose in women, but not in men.
   Coffee and tea consumption was negatively associated with MetS and some of its components.

AB Background: Helianthus annuus L. (sunflower) is well known for its edible oil, sunflower seed has been used as folk remedy for several diseases including cancer. Materials and Methods: In this study, SUNCA, a standardized extract enriched with chlorogenic acid (CGA) from sunflower seed was investigated for in vitro antidiabetic activity using alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase enzyme inhibition assay. Further, for preventing obesity, we demonstrated anti-adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cell culture system and on body weight gain and adiposity in rat fed high-fat diet (HFD). Results: SUNCA showed significant inhibitory activity toward digestive enzymes such as alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. On the other hand, SUNCA significantly inhibits lipid accumulation during adipogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment with 100 mu g/kg b.w of SUNCA apparently prevented the body weight gain and the increase of triglyceride and total cholesterol level in rat fed an HFD for 6 weeks. Further immunoblotting studies reveal that SUNCA significantly down-regulates the expression of transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, both in adipocytes and adipose tissues. Conclusion: The findings reported here provide the therapeutic potential of SUNCA, a standardized extract from Helanthus annus L.

AB Scope: The ability of high phenolic Rutgers Scarlet Lettuce (RSL) to attenuate metabolic syndrome and gut dysbiosis was studied in very high fat diet (VHFD)-fed mice. Phenolic absorption was assessed in vivo and in a gastrointestinal tract model.
   Methods and results: Mice were fed VHFD, VHFD supplemented with RSL (RSL-VHFD) or store-purchased green lettuce (GL-VHFD), or low-fat diet (LFD) for 13 weeks. Compared to VHFD or GL-VHFD-fed groups, RSL-VHFD group showed significantly improved oral glucose tolerance (p<0.05). Comparison of VHFD, RSL-VHFD, and GL-VHFD groups revealed no significant differences with respect to insulin tolerance, hepatic lipids, body weight gain, fat mass, plasma glucose, triglycerides, free fatty acid, and lipopolysaccharide levels, as well as relative abundances of major bacterial phyla from 16S rDNA amplicon data sequences (from fecal and cecal samples). However, RSL and GL-supplementation increased abundance of several taxa involved in plant polysaccharide degradation/fermentation. RSL phenolics chlorogenic acid, quercetin-3-glucoside, and quercetin-malonyl-glucoside were bioaccessible in the TIM-1 digestion model, but had relatively low recovery.
   Conclusions: RSL phenolics contributed to attenuation of post-prandial hyperglycemia. Changes in gut microbiota were likely due to microbiota accessible carbohydrates in RSL and GL rather than RSL phenolics, which may be metabolized, absorbed, or degraded before reaching the colon.

AB Coffee consumption is highly prevalent worldwide, and many studies have reported positive and inverse associations of coffee with many diseases. However, factors associated with coffee consumption remain poorly characterized in some populations, such as the elderly. This study aimed to assess the factors associated with total, caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption in an elderly population in Spain. Data were analyzed from 903 participants, aged 65 years and above, from two population-based studies carried out in the Valencia region in Spain (Valencia Nutritional Survey (VNS) and European Eye Study (EUREYE-Study). Total, caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption was assessed through two specific questions using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Information on personal characteristics, anthropometry and lifestyles was collected in personal interviews. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted relative risk ratios (RRR) and confidence intervals (95% CI). The prevalence of total, caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption was 70%, 38% and 32%, respectively. The consumption of caffeinated coffee was positively associated with: Educational level, RRR = 1.63 (1.09-2.44); body mass index (30), RRR = 2.03 (1.05-3.95); tobacco smoking, RRR = 1.96 (1.13-3.39); alcohol intake [12 g/day category intake vs. no-alcohol intake, RRR = 6.25 (3.56-10.95)]; and energy intake (p < 0.05). Consumption of caffeinated coffee was negatively associated with: Age (75 years), RRR = 0.64 (0.43-0.94); and pre-existing hypertension, RRR = 0.67 (0.45-0.98). The consumption of decaffeinated coffee was positively associated with: Alcohol intake, RRR = 2.63 (1.19-4.64); pre-existing diabetes, RRR = 1.67 (1.06-2.62); and energy intake (p < 0.01). The consumption of coffee is high among elderly people in Spain. It is a novelty in this study with elderly population that tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking were the two main factors associated with higher coffee consumption. Self-reported hypertension was associated with a lower consumption of caffeinated coffee, and pre-existing diabetes was associated with a higher consumption of decaffeinated coffee. These associations should be taken into account when the health effects of coffee consumption are investigated.

AB Coffee is associated with decreased breast cancer risk, but the impact of body mass index (BMI) in combination with coffee consumption on prognosis is unclear. The suppressive effect of coffee constituents on the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R) levels in breast cancer cells may play a role. The aim was to investigate the prognostic impact of coffee consumption and possible associations with tumor specific IGF1R protein expression and BMI in a population-based cohort in Sweden, comprising 1,014 primary breast cancer patients without pretreatment enrolled 2002-2012 and followed for up to 13 years. Patients with higher coffee consumption had lower tumor IGF1R levels (P = 0.025), but only among the normal-weight patients (P = 0.005). Coffee did not impact the recurrence-risk overall. However, tamoxifen-treated patients with ER+ tumors drinking >= 2 cups of coffee/day had lower recurrence-risk [adjusted HR (HRadj,) 0.57, 95% Cl, 0.34-0.97] compared with patients with lower intake, although only among normal-weight patients (HRad, 0.37, 95% Cl: 0.17-0.78; P-interaction = 0.039). Similarly, coffee consumption >= 2 cups/day was associated with significantly lower recurrence-risk among the 640 radiotherapy-treated patients irrespective of BMI (HRad, 0.59, 95% Cl 0.36-0.98) and in the 296 normal-weight patients (HR,d, 0.36, 95% Cl 0.17-0.76) but not in the 329 overweight or obese patients (HRadj, 0.88, 95% Cl 0.42-1.82) although the interaction was not significant (P-interaction = 0.093). In conclusion, coffee consumption was negatively associated with tumor-specific IGF1R levels only among normal-weight patients. Though, IGF1R did not explain the association between coffee intake and improved prognosis among normal weight tamoxifen-or radiotherapy-treated patients. Studies of IGF1R-targeting therapies may benefit from taking BMI and coffee consumption into account.

AB Yan-Sheng-Yin (YSY), a Chinese natural dietary supplement that promotes good health, is entirely composed of natural foods. Whether YSY is a potential adjuvant intervention for reducing hyperlipidaemia, atherogenesis, or obesity is unclear. This study evaluated the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of YSY for hyperlipidaemia, atherogenesis, and obesity. Experimental results showed that YSY reduced body weight, hyperlipidaemia, fatty liver, and atherogenesis in hyperlipidaemic mice. In addition, YSY promoted lipid metabolism by inducing adiponectin secretion and activation (phosphorylation) of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and by suppressing the activation of acetylCoA carboxylase (ACC) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Moreover, YSY inhibited adipocyte differentiation by suppressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs). Furthermore, the antihyperlipidaemic effect of YSY was observed in the clinical trial. Our findings suggest that YSY is an adjuvant intervention for treating and preventing hyperlipidaemia, atherogenesis, and obesity. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) increase risk of cardiometabolic disease. Young people consume the largest amounts of SSBs and have experienced the greatest relative gains in obesity in the past several decades. There is evidence of addictive properties of both caffeine and sugar, the primary ingredients in SSBs, but little research into such properties of SSBs in naturally occurring consumption patterns. Thus, in this exploratory study, we sought to examine potentially addictive properties of SSBs during a 3-day SSB cessation intervention in overweight and obese adolescents who typically consume >= 3 SSBs daily. Participants (n = 25) were aged 13-18 years, mostly female (72%), and African American (56%) or Hispanic (16%) with a BMI >= 95th percenttile (76%). Withdrawal symptoms and SSB craving were assessed approximately 1-week apart, during both regular SSB consumption and a 3-day period of SSB cessation in which participants were instructed to drink only plain milk and water. During SSB cessation, adolescents reported increased SSB cravings and headache and decreased motivation, contentment, ability to concentrate, and overall well-being (uncorrected Ps < 0.05). After controlling the false discovery rate, changes in motivation, craving, and well-being remained significant (corrected Ps < 0.05). Using 24-hr recalls and drink journals, participants reported lower total daily consumption of sugar (-80 g) and added sugar (-16 g) (Ps < 0.001) during cessation. This study provides preliminary evidence of withdrawal symptoms and increased SSB cravings during cessation in a diverse population of overweight or obese adolescents.

AB Early weaning (EW) leads to overweight, visceral obesity, hyperleptinemia, and insulin resistance in adulthood. Treatment with llex paraguariensis (yerba mate) improves obesity and insulin resistance in these animals. Here, we evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with yerba mate on the redox balance and liver morphology of overweight early-weaned rats. To induce EW, we wrapped the dams with bandages to interrupt milk access during the last 3 days of lactation. Control pups (C) had free access to maternal milk for the full 21 days of lactation. On postnatal day (PN) 150, EW offspring were subdivided into the EW +YM group, which received the aqueous extract of yerba mate (1 g/kg bw by gavage once a day for 30 days) and the EW group, which received water by gavage for the same period. All rats were euthanized on PN180. The EW group showed higher bound carbonyl (a marker of total protein oxidation), higher TBARS levels (a marker of lipid peroxidation), and lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in liver tissue than the C group, as well as higher triglyceride content and microsteatosis. In plasma, the EW offspring showed higher TBARS levels. One month of yerba mate treatment normalized these parameters. Thus, we have shown evidence that yerba mate improved antioxidant defenses and mitigated liver dysfunction in overweight adult rats that were weaned prematurely.

AB Background: Coffee consumption has been associated with glucose metabolism and risk of type 2 diabetes.
   Objective: We examined whether the genetic variation determining habitual coffee consumption affected glycemic changes in response to weight-loss dietary intervention.
   Design: A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated based on 8 habitual coffee consumption-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. We used general linear models to test changes in glycemic traits in groups randomly assigned to high-and low-fat diets according to tertiles of the GRS.
   Results: We observed significant interactions between the GRS and low compared with high dietary fat intake on 6-mo changes in fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR) (P-interaction = 0.023 and 0.022, respectively), adjusting for age, sex, race, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, seasonal variation, and baseline values of the respective outcomes. Participants with a higher GRS of habitual coffee consumption showed a greater reduction in fasting insulin and a marginally greater decrease in HOMA-IR in the low-fat diet intervention group.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that participants with genetically determined high coffee consumption may benefit more by eating a low-fat diet in improving fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in a short term.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In-utero exposures through adverse fetal programming are emerging as an important contributing factor to the epidemic of childhood obesity. This study examines the impact of in-utero exposure to caffeine on the risk of childhood obesity in offspring.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: A prospective study of pregnant women with 15 years follow-up of their offspring was conducted to examine the impact of in-utero exposure to caffeine on the risk of childhood obesity. Maternal caffeine intake was prospectively ascertained during pregnancy and outcome measures (body mass index (BMI)) were ascertained from medical charts, with 17 BMI measurements per child, on average, during the follow-up period. Potential confounders including known perinatal risk factors for childhood obesity were adjusted for using the generalized estimating equations model with repeated measurements.
   RESULTS: After controlling for potential confounders, compared with those without caffeine exposure, in-utero exposure to caffeine overall is associated with 87% increased risk of childhood obesity: odds ratio (OR) = 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-3.12. This association demonstrated a dose-response relationship: OR = 1.77 (1.05-3.00) for maternal daily caffeine intake <150mg per day, OR = 2.37 (1.24-4.52) for caffeine intake >= 150 mg per day during pregnancy, respectively. We also observed a linear relationship: every one unit increase (log(10) scale) in the amount of maternal caffeine intake was associated with 23% increased risk of obesity in offspring. The dose-response relationship appears stronger for persistent obesity than for transitory obesity (occasional high BMI), and for girls than for boys.
   CONCLUSIONS: We observed an association of in-utero exposure to caffeine with increased risk of childhood obesity. If this observation is further replicated in other studies, the finding will contribute to the understanding of fetal programming of childhood diseases and development of intervention strategy to prevent childhood obesity.

AB Brown adipose tissue (BAT) prevents obesity and related diseases by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation with adenosine triphosphate. Previous studies have demonstrated that polyphenols can promote the thermogenesis of BAT in mice. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a common phenolic acid found in fruits and vegetables, as well as traditional Chinese medicine, which is responsible for a variety of physiological activities. However, it is still unclear whether CGA has positive effects on the thermogenesis of BAT. In this study, CGA enhances the thermogenesis and proton leak of brown adipocytes, however, no changes are evident regarding the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 into brown adipocytes. Surprisingly, CGA promotes the uptake of glucose by upregulating the glucose transporter 2 and phosphofructokinase. Moreover, CGA increases the number and the function of mitochondrial. Taken together, CGA stimulates thermogenesis of brown adipocytes by promoting the uptake of glucose and the function of mitochondria. Practical Application Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is widely found in fruits, vegetables, and traditional Chinese medicines, which has been considered to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory function. However, whether it has the function of resisting obesity and promoting thermogenesis is still unclear. In this study, brown adipocyte was used to explore the function and mechanism of CGA on thermogenesis. It provides new ideas for the utilization of foods rich in CGA and traditional Chinese medicine.

AB Background: Several compounds contained in coffee have been found to suppress carcinogenesis in experimental studies. We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to assess the impact of coffee consumption on the risk of endometrial cancer. Materials and methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies published up to August 2016. Using random effects models, we estimated summary relative risks (RR) for cohort studies and odds ratios (OR) for case-control studies with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Dose-response analyses were conducted by using generalized least square trend estimation. Results: We identified 12 cohort studies and 8 case-control studies eligible for inclusion, contributing with 11,663 and 2,746 endometrial cancer cases, respectively. The summary RR for highest compared with lowest coffee intake was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.68-0.81; p(heterogeneity) = 0.09, I-2 = 32%). The corresponding summary RR among cohort studies was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.71-0.85; p(heterogeneity) = 0.14, I-2 = 31.9%) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.53-0.76; p(heterogeneity) = 0.57, I-2 = 0%) for case-control studies. One-cup increment per day was associated with 3% risk reduction (95% CI: 2-4%) in cohort studies and 12% (95% CI: 5-18%) in case-control studies. After pooling the results from 5 cohort studies, the association remained significant only in women with body mass index over 30 (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.81). Conclusion: The results from our meta-analysis strengthen the evidence of a protective effect of coffee consumption on the risk of EC and further suggest that increased coffee intake might be particularly beneficial for women with obesity.

AB Obesity is one of the most challenging health issue worldwide that has been steadily increasing in the last decades. Obesity arises from a positive energy balance in result of increased intake and decreased energy expenditure, usually due to inadequate dietary habits and a sedentary lifestyle, which results in the accumulation of excess body fat. There are few pharmacological tools to address obesity, thus calorie restriction and increased physical activity are still the cornerstone of obesity treatment. In recent years, natural products obtained from plants have been thoroughly studied to infer whether these have any potential to target obesity. Methylxanthines comprise one of those classes of compounds that are abundant in common food products consumed on a daily basis worldwide, such as coffee, chocolate, or tea. Despite caffeine is the most popular and well-studied methylxanthine, theobromine and theophylline are also abundant in humans' diet. Notably, methylxanthines proved to stimulate lipolysis and inhibit adipogenesis, which are interesting properties that could contribute for obesity management. This review aims to discuss the most recent information concerning the promising role of methylxanthines in the modulation of adipose tissue functions, highlighting the potential of these molecules in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for obesity treatment.

AB We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effect of green tea, caffeine and capsaicin supplements on the anthropometric indices in adults. PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Cochran and Web of Science databases were searched up to March 2017. Green tea significantly reduced weight by -0.65 kg (-1.10 to -0.20, P = 0.005), body mass index (BMI) by -0.26 kg/m(2) (-0.43 to -0.10, P = 0.002) and waist circumference by -1.11 cm (-1.99 to -0.23, P = 0.01) but not percent of body fat (PBF) (-1.42%, 95% CI: -3.02 to 0.18, P = 0.08). Caffeine supplement had no effect on weight (-2.99 kg, 95% CI: - 7.83 to 1.41, P = 0.18). We observed a significant weight loss after capsaicin supplement (-0.50 kg; 95% CI: -0.90 to -0.11, P = 0.01) but PBF did not change significantly from baseline (0.11%, 95% CI: -0.22 to 0.43, P = 0.51). Green tea and capsaicin supplements have a significant mild weight-lowering effect. On the contrary, it seems caffeine had no effect on weight.

AB Human gut flora-mediated non-digestible fraction of spent coffee grounds (hgf-NDSCG) was evaluated for its chemopreventive effect and molecular mechanisms involved on human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cell survival using two different microbiota source [lean (L) and overweight (OW)]. The source of human gut flora (hgf) (L or OW) affected the pH of hgf-NDSCG only minimally, but linearly reduced those of hgf-inulin. The variability between lean and overweight microbiota was characterized by the metabolism and/or bioaccessibility of different phenolic metabolites, their intermediate and end products as well as by variable time courses. Apoptosis of colon cancer HT-29 cells depended on the microbiota source with the lean microbiota expressing a low lethal concentration 50 (LC50/L-hgf-NDSCG = 13.5%). We demonstrate that NDSCG and its colonic metabolite from lean microbiota induced HT-29 cell apoptosis by reducing catalase and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 alpha as biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress as the primary mechanism underlying its overall chemoprotection against colon cancer.

AB Background: Coffea arabica pulp (CP) is the first by-product obtained from coffee berries during coffee processing. The major constituents of CP, including chlorogenic acid, caffeine, and epicatechin exhibit anti-hyperlipidemic effects in in vitro and in vivo models. Whether Coffea arabica pulp aqueous extract (CPE) has a lipid-lowering effect remains unknown.
   Purpose: This study examined the effect of CPE on cholesterol absorption, and identified the mechanisms involved in lowered cholesterol in in vitro and in vivo models.
   Methods: Uptake of [H-3]-cholesterol micelles and the mode of CPE inhibition were determined using human intestinal Caco-2 cells, and subsequently, confirmed using isolated rat jejunal loops. In addition, the 12-week high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemic rats (HF) received either CPE (1000 mg/kg BW), a sole and high dose which was selected because it contained approximately 12 mg of CGA that was previously shown to have lipid-lowering effects, or ezetimibe (10 mg/kg BW), a cholesterol inhibitor. The rats were divided into HF, HF + + CPE, and HF + + ezetimibe groups for the next 12 weeks. Normal rats received a normal diet (ND) and CPE (ND + CPE). Body weights and lipid profiles were evaluated. Cholesterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), protein expression and liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha) mRNA expression were determined. In vitro micellar complex properties were also investigated.
   Results: CPE inhibited [H-3]-cholesterol micelle transport in Caco-2 cells and rat jejunal loops in a dose-dependent, non-competitive manner partly by decreasing membrane NPC1L1 expression. Congruently, CPE and its major constituents activated LXR alpha which, in turn, down-regulated NPC1L1. Furthermore, CPE interfered with physicochemical characteristics of cholesterol mixed micelles. These data were consistent with decreased body weight and slowed body weight gain and improved lipid profiles by CPE in hypercholesterolemic rats while no change occurred in these parameters in normal rats. Down-regulated intestinal NPC1L1 expression mediated by increased LXR alpha mRNA were also observed in HF + + CPE and ND + CPE rats.
   Conclusion: CPE has a cholesterol-lowering effect in in vitro and in vivo via inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption by down-regulating NPC1L1 mediated LXR alpha activation and interfering with micellar complex formation. Accordingly, CPE could be developed as nutraceutical product to prevent dyslipidemia-induced obesity and insulin resistance.

AB This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to summarize the effect of caffeine intake on weight loss. We searched the following databases until November 2017: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The relevant data were extracted and assessed for quality of the studies according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We estimated an intake-status regression coefficient (Beta) for each primary study and estimated the overall pooled Beta and SE using random effects meta-analysis on a double-log scale. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and I-squared tests (I-2). Thirteen RCTs with 606 participants were included in the meta-analyses. The overall pooled Beta for the effect of caffeine intake was 0.29 (95%CI: 0.19, 0.40; Q = 124.5, I-2 = 91.2%) for weigh, 0.23 (95%CI: 0.09, 0.36; Q = 71.0, I-2 = 93.0%) for BMI, and 0.36 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.48; Q = 167.36, I-2 = 94.0%) for fat mass. For every doubling in caffeine intake, the mean reduction in weight, BMI, and fat mass increased 2 Beta-fold (20.29 = 1.22, 20.23 = 1.17, and 20.36 = 1.28), which corresponding to 22, 17, and 28 percent, respectively. Overall, the current meta-analysis demonstrated that caffeine intake might promote weight, BMI and body fat reduction.

AB Excessive sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption has been associated with overweight and obesity. Caffeine is a common additive to SSB, and through dependence effects, it has the potential to promote the consumption of caffeine-containing foods. The objective of the present study was to assess the influence that caffeine has on the consumption of SSB. Participants (n 99) were blindly assigned to either a caffeinated SSB (C-SSB) or a non-caffeinated SSB (NC-SSB) group. Following randomisation, all participants completed a 9 d flavour-conditioning paradigm. They then completed a 28 d ad libitum intake intervention where they consumed as much or as little of C-SSB or NC-SSB as desired. The amount consumed (ml) was recorded daily, 4 d diet diaries were collected and liking of SSB was assessed at the start and end of the intervention. Participants (n 50) consuming the C-SSB had a daily SSB intake of 419 (SD 298) ml (785 (SD 559) kJ/d) over the 28 d intervention, significantly more than participants (n 49) consuming the NC-SSB (273 (SD 278) ml/d, 512 (SD 521) kJ/d) (P<0.001). A trained flavour panel (n 30) found no difference in flavour between the C-SSB and NC-SSB (P>0.05). However, participants who consumed the C-SSB liked the SSB more than those who consumed the NC-SSB (6.3 v. 6.0 on a nine-point hedonic scale, P<0.022). The addition of low concentrations of caffeine to the SSB significantly increases the consumption of the SSB. Regulating caffeine as a food additive may be an effective strategy to decrease the consumption of nutrient-poor high-energy foods and beverages.

AB Some species of the Ericaceae family have been intensively studied because of the beneficial health impact, known since ancient times, of their chemical components. Since most studies focus on the effects of fruit consumption, this review aims to highlight the phenolic components present in the leaves. For this purpose, five species from Ericaceae family (bilberryVaccinium myrtillus L., lingonberryV. vitis-idaea L., bog bilberryV. uliginosum L., blueberryV. corymbosum L. and bearberryArctostapylos uva-ursi L.) were considered, four of which can be found in spontaneous flora. The chemical composition of the leaves revealed three major phenolic compounds: chlorogenic acid, quercetin and arbutin. The health promoting functions of these compounds, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could have preventive effects for cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and obesity, have been exemplified by both in vitro and in vivo studies in this review. Furthermore, the importance of bioaccessibility and bioavailability of the phenolic compounds have been summarized. The findings highlight the fact that leaves of some Ericaceae species deserve increased attention and should be studied more profoundly for their biological activities, especially those from spontaneous flora.

AB Our double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-escalation, clinical trial aimed to test the effect of a combined nutraceutical containing bergamot extract (120-mg flavonoids), phytosterols, vitamin C, and chlorogenic acid from dry artichoke extract on 90 overweight dyslipidemic subjects. Participants were randomly allocated to treatment with two pills of either active treatment or placebo, or a combination of both (a pill per treatment). After 8 weeks, all active-treated groups experienced a significant improvement in triglycerides (TG) versus placebo and in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) versus baseline and placebo treatments. In the high-dose-treated group, also total cholesterol (TC), nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), gamma-glutamil transpeptidasi, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) significantly decreased. At 24-week follow-up, TG levels maintained lower than baseline in all groups. All patients allocated to either low-dose or high-dose active treatment experienced a significant decrease in TG, LDL-C, and homeostatin model assessment of insulin resistance. In subjects taking high-dose active treatment, adiponectin significantly increased, whereas TC, non-HDL-C, insulin (fasting plasma insulin), leptin, leptin/adiponectin ratio, hs-CRP, and TNF-alpha were significantly reduced. The tested nutraceutical showed to improve lipid and glucose metabolism, adipokines pattern, and systemic inflammation in dyslipidemic overweight subjects.

AB Whilst pervasive food insecurity exists among adolescents in Ethiopia, the available information is scant and inconsistent. Therefore, the main objective of this cross-sectional study was to contribute to these gaps by assessing the food security of adolescents in the selected khat- and coffee-growing areas. We selected 234 (117 girls and 117 boys) adolescents aged 12-18 years via stratified random sampling. We measured the height and weight of the adolescents and asked about their food insecurity experiences. We assessed the prevalence of stunting and thinness using the WHO 2007 growth reference standards. Out of the total, 17 (7.3%) and 30 (12.8%) adolescents were stunted and thin, respectively. In addition, 89 (38.0%) adolescents reported food insecurity experiences and nine (3.8%) were overweight. A regression analyses showed that the stunting was associated with the age of the adolescents and maternal education. Thinness was associated with area, gender, and the number of meals. Food insecurity experiences were associated with health problems in the past 30 days. In general, adolescents from the khat-growing area have better food security than those from the coffee-growing area, and the same is true, gender-wise, for girls compared to boys. We recommend possible interventions primarily for adolescents in coffee-growing areas.

AB Although changes in Brazilian diet have occurred over the last decades, there is no evidence about differences in food portion sizes (FPS) over time. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association of FPS with excess body weight (EBW), and to monitor differences in the population from SAo Paulo, Brazil, from 2003 to 2015. Data came from three cross-sectional population-based studies with 5270 individuals aged 12 years in 2003, 2008, and 2015. Dietary data were obtained from 24-h recalls. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between FPS and EBW. Over the years, there was a diverse variation in FPS, with an increase in some groups (white meat, salted snacks, coffee/tea, eggs) and decrease in others (rice, red meat, sweets, pasta, sandwiches, cold cuts). The percentage of people reporting the intake of six food groupings (rice, white meat, sweets, fruits, commercial juices, toasts/biscuits) increased in the period. In this population, EBW was associated with larger FPS of 11 of the 30 food groupings investigated (cold cuts, fried snacks, fruit and commercial juices, pizza, red meat, rice, salted snacks, soft drinks, soups, sugar). These findings could support future interventions and policies for optimal food intake in Brazil.

AB Background: Recently, considerable attention has been given to beverage intake as a source of calories which may be linked to pediatric obesity. Objective: To examine the association between beverage consumption and changes in weight status among adolescents. Material/Methods: A total of 600 adolescents, aged 14-18 years, were involved in the study. Body weight, height, and waist circumference were measured. BMI percentiles were calculated and adolescents were classified as normal weight, overweight, and obese. For the collection of data on beverage intake, the 24-h recall technique was used. Data on beverages were examined in milliliters. Results: Of the total 600 participants in our sample, 79.3% were considered to be of normal weight, 13.3% were overweight and 7.4% were obese. All of the adolescents consumed water. Tea was the second most commonly consumed beverage (80.8%), followed by sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs, 49.3%), and whole fat milk (24.3%). Elevated consumption of water was associated with elevated weight, BMI and waist circumference. There was no evidence of an association among milk, fruit juice, SSBs, tea, coffee consumption and weight status. Conclusion: In this study, water intake was associated with obesity. Further studies investigating the relationship among beverage consumption, total energy intake, and development of obesity are needed.

AB Background: Dietary intake patterns of children from the 2004 Pelotas birth cohort study have been described at 12, 24 and 48 months of age, but there is no information about dietary patterns of these children at 6 years. Then, we aimed to identify and describe dietary intake patterns of children aged 6 years as well as to assess their association with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, early feeding practices and BMI z-score at 6 years.
   Methods: We used principal components analysis to identify dietary intake patterns of 3,427 children from the 2004 Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohort study. We used multiple linear regression models to evaluate whether socioeconomic and demographic characteristics (socioeconomic position, mother's age at birth, and child's sex and skin colour), early feeding practices (exclusive breastfeeding duration and age of introduction of complementary foods), and BMI z-score at 6 years were associated with dietary intake patterns.
   Results: We identified seven dietary components of children's dietary intake patterns, namely: fruits and vegetables, snacks and treats, coffee and bread, milk, cheese and processed meats, rice and beans and carbohydrates. Dietary patterns were socially patterned, since six dietary components were associated with socioeconomic position. Moreover, high intake of snacks and treats and less fruits and vegetables were associated with children born to teenage mothers, with those exclusively breastfed for less than one month, and with those who started on complementary feeding before 4 months. Finally, overweight and obese children at 6 years presented lower intake of four out of seven dietary components, but we need to be cautious in interpretation due to limitations on food consumption reporting and due to possible reverse causality.
   Conclusion: Dietary intake patterns in children are strongly influenced by socioeconomic characteristics. Other factors such as younger maternal age at birth, and both early weaning and early introduction of complementary feeding appear to be related with 'nhealthier' patterns. Overweight and obese children presented lower intake of four out of seven dietary components, but further studies would be interesting to understand the longitudinal effect of children's feeding practices on BMI and adiposity.

AB Objective: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is involved in energy dissipation and cytokine production and is potentially beneficial for the human body. The aim of the paper is to review the literature on adiposity-related cancer and functional imaging of BAT.
   Methods: We performed a review on adiposity-related cancer and functional imaging of BAT. We extensively researched papers for information on BAT molecular biology, as well as functional imaging modalities.
   Results: Adipose tissue is linked to the development of many cancers. Multiple drugs including fenofibrate, spironolactone, and other substances, as well as experimental agents like b-3 receptor agonists, caffeine, green tea extract, medium chain triglycerides (MCTs), and adenosine are known to stimulate and activate BAT. However, cold and nonshivering thermogenesis are the main activators of BAT. BAT has been detected on both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fluorodexoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET)-based imaging in multiple studies. Different methods of cold stimulation and static and dynamic protocols have been used to detect and image BAT. Factors like sex, fasting or fed state, surface skin temperature, and/or body mass index (BMI) may influence PET-based BAT detection. BAT has also been detected using MRI, (99m)Technetium(Tc)-sestamibi, and 123I- metaiodobenzylguanidine single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (MIBG SPECT/CT).
   Conclusions: Stimulation of BAT offers promise in the management of obesity-related conditions. Tracers like [O-15]-H2O, [C-11] acetate, and 18F-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid (18F-FTHA) that measure BAT blood flow, oxygen utilization, and nonessential fatty acid (NEFA) uptake, respectively, have been studied in humans. Future studies should focus on BAT tissue generation by altering the genetic pathways of adiposity-linked genes.

AB Obesity is a serious disease that can be due to genetic and environmental reasons and is defined by the World Health Organization as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. There is an increasing trend towards herbal slimming products in obesity treatment. The quality control analysis of these products is important for public health. In this study, new, simple, and sensitive high performance liquid chromatography methods were developed for qualitative and quantitative determination of arbutin, hydroquinone, ursolic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and catechin in eleven herbal slimming products in Turkey containing Camellia sinensis, Ilex paraguariensis, and Calluna vulgaris. The intra- and interday precisions, stated as the relative standard deviation, were less than 2% and accuracy, based on relative error, was less than 10%. The limits of detection and quantification for arbutin and hydroquinone were 0.80 and 2.40 mu g/mL and for the other compounds were 0.30 and 0.90 mu g/mL, respectively. The methods developed can be used for routine quality control analysis of these effective compounds in different herbal slimming products.

AB Herbal plants have been assessed for possible action that influence gastrointestinal hormonal secretion, modifying gut motility, food intake and energy balance. The effects of herbal extracts derived from native species of South America on food intake and acylated ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentrations after consuming meals were investigated for the first time in humans. Twenty overweight and obese women were recruited for a randomized, single blind, placebo -controlled, crossover design study separated by a 7-day washout period. Participants received an herbal extract combination containing yerba mate, guarana and damiana ('YGD') or placebo. Energy intake at lunch was reduced significantly in the YGD group (-43.3 +/- 13.1 kcal; P = 0.005). The AUC for acylated ghrelin after lunch was significantly lower in the YGD group (-1004 +/- 690.9 vs. 565.9 +/- 286.7, P = 0.04). At 60 and 150 min after breakfast, GLP-1 concentrations were higher in YGD (P = 0.04) when compared with the control group. The AUC for GLP-1 after breakfast was significantly higher in the YGD group (1003 +/- 370.5 vs. 160.3 +/- 221.3, P < 0.05). Supplementation with the herbal extract YGD reduced energy and macronutrient intake by modulating the gut hormones in overweight and obese women. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID YOUNG-ADULTS; PREVALENCE; INACTIVITY
AB Physical inactivity is a well-known risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases and counts as fourth leading cause of death worldwide. The study aimed to elucidate to what extent cardiovascular risk factors exist in university students in Somaliland. In a cross-sectional survey, self-administered questionnaires were used to elucidate existence of cardiovascular risk factors in 173 university students (117 male, 56 female) in Hargeisa, Somaliland. Information elucidated included socio-economic and demographic data in addition to questions on coffee intake, on physical activity behavior, type of sport/activity and intensity and duration. Height and weight were taken, as was blood pressure (BP). Median age was 23 years in male and 20 years in female students. Mean BMI was 19.7 in male and 21.8 in female students. The prevalence rates of elevated BP and overweight (BMI a parts per thousand yen 25) in female and male students were, 0 versus 9 and 14 versus 7 %, respectively. Coffee consumption was reported by 39 % of students. None of the female students reported smoking cigarettes, while 5.1 % of the male students did. Physical inactivity was reported by 52 % of the female students and 27 % of the male students (p = 0.01). Overall, male students reported a higher degree and intensity of physical activity. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors is low in female and male university students in Somaliland. However, the results demonstrate a high degree of physical inactivity and overweight might become a problem in the future. This issue should be addressed by increasing the motivation and opportunities for physical activity in students.

AB Purpose Habitual consumers of different coffee types may vary in socioeconomic status (SES), which is an important determinant of diet quality. Nonetheless, research on diet quality among coffee consumers was scarce. We aimed to compare the diet quality of coffee consumers with different preferences towards coffee type and additive usage.
   Methods In this cross-sectional analysis, intake data of food, coffee, and additive usage from the adult respondents of the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey were used. Participants were grouped according to the type of coffee (espresso and ground coffee, E & G; coffee made from coffee mixes and instant coffee, M & I; non-consumers, NC) and additives (milk, sugar, and intense sweetener) consumed. Adjusted food group intake was compared between consumption groups using general linear model.
   Results E&G drinkers had better SES than M&I and NC. After adjusting for covariates, the mean dairy intake of E&G drinkers was 22.2% higher than M&I drinkers (p < 0.001) and 33.1% higher than NC (p < 0.001). Mean discretionary food intake of E&G drinkers was 12.1% lower than M&I (p = 0.003) and 12.3% lower than NC (p = 0.001). In terms of additive usage, non-users of coffee additive had the lowest dairy food intake and the highest discretionary food intake.
   Conclusions Coffee consumers' different preferences towards coffee type and additive usages reflected significant variations in their diet quality, even after adjustment of SES. Therefore, future epidemiological studies should consider separating coffee drinkers according to their habitual consumption of different types of coffee.

AB This study evaluated the effect of ingesting a flavonoid-rich supplement (329 mg/d) on total urine phenolics and shifts in plasma metabolites in overweight/obese female adults using untargeted metabolomics procedures. Participants (N = 103, 18-65 y, BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)) were randomized to flavonoid (F) or placebo (P) groups for 12 weeks with blood and 24 h urine samples collected prestudy and after 4 and 12 weeks in a parallel design. Supplements were prepared as chewable tablets and included vitamin C, wild bilberry fruit extract, green tea leaf extract, quercetin, caffeine, and omega 3 fatty acids. At 4 weeks, urine total phenolics increased 24% in F versus P with similar changes at 12 weeks (interaction effect, P = 0.041). Groups did not differ in markers of inflammation (IL-6, MCP-1, CRP) or oxidative stress (oxLDL, FRAP). Metabolomics data indicated shifts in 63 biochemicals in F versus P with 70% from the lipid and xenobiotics superpathways. The largest fold changes in F were measured for three gut-derived phenolics including 3-methoxycatechol sulfate, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-propanoic acid sulfate, and 1,2,3-benzenetriol sulfate (interaction effects, p <= 0.050). This randomized trial of overweight/obese women showed that 12 weeks ingestion of a mixed flavonoid nutrient supplement was associated with a corresponding increase in urine total phenolics and gut-derived phenolic metabolites.

AB The inconsistent findings regarding green tea intake and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in several epidemiological studies might result from variations in lifestyle factors. Therefore, we examined whether increased green tea intake was associated with a decreased risk of CRC and how the risk of CRC was altered by the protective effect of green tea consumption and five health-related factors. A case-control study including 2742 participants (922 cases and 1820 controls) was conducted in Korea. Green tea consumption was assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. The risk of CRC was approximately 40% less in the participants in the highest green tea intake tertile than in participants in the lowest green tea intake tertile. Of the five lifestyle factors examined, high body mass index and physical inactivity were independent risk factors for CRC. Regarding the interactions between tea consumption and lifestyle factors, high green tea consumption was associated with a decreased risk of CRC, with or without considering lifestyle factors. However, moderate green tea consumption increased the risk of CRC among ever-smokers, ever-drinkers and the high-inflammatory diet group. Increased consumption of green tea might be helpful to reduce the risk of CRC in those with an unhealthy lifestyle.

AB Background: The exact mechanism(s) of atherosclerosis in humans remains elusive, but one theory hypothesizes that this deleterious process results from the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Research suggests that foods rich in dietary phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity can mitigate the extent of LDL oxidation in vivo. With regard to the different classes of flavonoids, there appears to be a structurefunction relationship between the various moieties/ constituents attached to the flavonoids' three ring system and their impact at retarding LDL oxidation.
   Methods: This article summarizes the findings to date of both in vitro and in vivo studies using foods or phenolic extracts isolated from foodstuffs at inhibiting the incidence of LDL oxidation. Three bases: SCOPUS, Web Science, and PubMed were used for search.
   Results: An often used method for the determination of antioxidant properties of natural phenolic compounds is the LDL oxidation assay. LDLs are isolated from human plasma and their oxidation is induced by Cu2+ ions or 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH). The sample is incubated with a phenolic extract or individual/ isolated phenolic compounds. LDL oxidation is then monitored by various chemical methods (e.g., measurement of the generation of conjugated dienes and trienes). This technique confirmed the antioxidant properties of several extracts as obtained from plant material (e.g., grapes, berries, orange, grapefruit, coffee, tea, chocolate, olives, nuts) as well as the individual phenolic compounds (e.g., luteolinidin, apigenidin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, catechin, quercetin, rutin). Several studies in vivo confirmed protective effects of phenolic compounds against LDL oxidation. They covered the healthy subjects with hyperlipidaemia, overweight, obesity, metabolic syndrome, heavy smokers, patients receiving haemodialysis, patients with peripheral vascular disease, and subjects at high cardiovascular risk. The studies comprise individuals of all ages, and the number of participants in the different experiments varied widely.
   Conclusion: Properly designed double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials offer stronger evidence as to the impact of dietary phenolics consumption at retarding LDL oxidation. More such clinical trials are needed to strengthen the hypothesis that foods rich in dietary phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity can mitigate the extent of LDL oxidation in vivo.

AB This study was performed to examine the effects of long-term caffeine-intake, with and without exercise, on the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in an obese diabetic rat model. Thirty-two male Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats were assigned to sedentary (OLETF-Sed), exercise (OLETF-Ex), caffeine-intake (OLETF-Caf), and combined (OLETF-Caf + Ex) groups. Caffeine-intake groups were fed rat chow containing caffeine (90.7 +/- 4.7 mg/kg/day). The OLETF-Ex and OLETF-Caf + Ex groups were able to run voluntarily at any time using a rotatory wheel. Body weight (BW) and blood pressure (BP) were measured weekly from 24 to 29 wk of age. Pre- and posttreatment serum glucose, insulin, and creatinine concentrations were measured, and a 24 h urine sample was collected for measurement of creatinine clearance (Ccr) and albumin excretion (UEAlb). After treatment, the kidneys were removed for morphological analysis. The OLETF-Caf and OLETF-Caf + Ex groups exhibited no BP increase during the study. Both the caffeine-intake groups exhibited a significant increase in urine volume (UV), electrolyte excretion, and Ccr, and decreased UEAlb, following treatment. Furthermore, no structural damage was observed in the kidneys of rats from either caffeine-intake group, whereas the OLETF-Sed and OLETF-Ex groups exhibited DN progression. This study demonstrates that caffeine-intake alone and/or combined with exercise significantly decreases BW and improves glucose intolerance, without the progression of DN. Further research should be performed to examine whether the quantities of caffeine contained in a normal human daily intake also have a protective effect against kidney damage.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present study showed that caffeine administration alone and/or combined with exercise results in an improvement of diabetic nephropathy (DN), including an increase in creatinine clearance and urinary Na excretion, a decrease in urinary protein excretion, and in renal morphological findings. To our knowledge, there are no other studies showing that caffeine administration inhibits DN progression.

AB Background: Energy drinks (EDs) are extremely popular among adults and adolescents. Regular intake of EDs may lead to an overdose of caffeine, loss of bone mass, overweight, hypertension and, in older age, osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. Some people mix EDs with alcohol, which adversely affects their health. The objective of this study was to analyze the consumption of EDs by adolescents. Methods: The study consisted of a questionnaire surveying amounts of drinks, preferences and product awareness among younger consumers. The study was carried out in junior and senior high schools in Poland (n = 2629). Results: EDs were consumed by 67% of students (quite frequently by 16%). Students who practiced sports were more willing to drink EDs. Also, boys drank them more often than girls. When selecting a particular ED, young people looked at the taste, price and effect. Most respondents consumed one ED (250 mL) daily, although there were individuals consuming two or more drinks daily. Most respondents knew the ingredients of EDs, and 24% admitted to mixing EDs with alcohol. Conclusions: EDs are extremely popular among adolescents. Young people drinking EDs every day are potentially at risk of taking an overdose of caffeine.

AB Purple lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is a type of low caloric vegetable often consumed freshly, whereas its function in metabolic control has been little studied. To investigate the protective effect of a type of purple lettuce against metabolic risk factors, we treated the C57BL/6J DIO mice with or without purple lettuces for 8 weeks. Results showed that purple lettuce effectively attenuated many metabolic risk factors in DIO mice. Typically, purple lettuce prevented the body weight gain by reducing fat mass accumulation and increasing energy expenditure. Additionally, consumption of purple lettuces enhanced glucose homeostasis, increased insulin sensitivity and improved the lipid profile in the DIO mice. This was, at least partly, attributable to its abundance of bioactive molecules like esculin and chlorogenic acid. High intake of purple lettuces modulated the intestinal microbiota composition like decreased Lachnospiraceae. We conclude that purple lettuce has great potential as functional foods in prevention of metabolic disorders.

AB Polyphenols are a group of substances present in plant-based foods such as apples and in plant-based beverages such as red wine. This review shows that polyphenols interfere with intestinal sugar transporters, modulating their function and altering glucose and fructose absorption. Inhibition of intestinal glucose and fructose absorption contributes to the effect of polyphenols in reducing postprandial glycemia, altering the apparent glycemic index of foods and decreasing body mass index. The possible implication of these findings on type 2 diabetes and obesity is a matter of growing interest, as shown by the rise on publications on this subject.

AB Background: This study was conducted to determine the effects of dietary supplements containing green tea, capsaicin and ginger extracts on weight loss and metabolic profiles among overweight women.
   Methods: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was implemented among 50 overweight women. Participants were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group A received dietary supplements containing 125 mg green tea, 25 mg capsaicin and 50 mg ginger extracts (n = 25) group B received placebos (n = 25) twice with lunch and twice with dinner daily for 8 weeks.
   Results: Compared with placebo, taking dietary supplements containing green tea, capsaicin and ginger resulted in a significant decrease in weight (-1.8 +/- 1.5 vs. +0.4 +/- 1.2 kg, respectively, p < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI; -0.7 +/- 0.5 vs. +0.1 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2), respectively, p < 0.001). In addition, subjects who received green tea, capsaicin and ginger co-supplements had significantly decreased serum insulin concentrations (-2.6 +/- 3.9 vs. -0.6 +/- 2.0 mu IU/mL, p = 0.02), homeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance (-0.5 +/- 0.8 vs. -0.05 +/- 0.6, p = 0.01), and increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.01 +/- 0.01 vs. +0.001 +/- 0.01, p = 0.008) and plasma glutathione (GSH) levels (+73.8 +/- 120.6 vs. -28.3 +/- 193.4 mu mol/L, p = 0.03) compared with the placebo.
   Conclusions: Our study indicated that taking green tea, capsaicin and ginger co-supplements for 8 weeks among overweight women had beneficial effects on weight, BMI, markers of insulin metabolism and plasma GSH levels. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Consumption of energy drinks has adverse effects on the heart that might be potentiated in obese individuals. Since the incidence of obesity and use of energy drinks is high among Saudi youth, we used non-invasive tests to study hemodynamic changes produced by altered autonomic cardiac activity following consumption of energy drinks in obese male students.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: This cross-sectional study was carried out at Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, University of Dammam, Saudi Arabia, over a one-year period from December 2013 to December 2014.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In Saudi male university students we measured continuous ECG recordings and a one-minute deep breathing maneuver to measure the expiratory-to-inspiratory ratio, the mean heart rate range (MHRR), the mean percentage variability. (M% VHR) and the corrected QT interval (QTc) at 0, 30 and 60 minutes after consumption of energy drink.
   RESULTS: We enrolled 31 students (18 overweight/obese and 13 normal weights. QTc was significantly increased at 60 min as compared with the resting state in overweight/obese subjects (P=.006). Heart rate variability was significantly less in obese as compared with normal weight subjects at 60 minutes as indicated by E:I ratio, (P=.037), MHRR (P=.012), M% VHR (P=.040) after energy drink consumption. Significant increases in diastolic (P=.020) and mean arterial blood pressure (P=.024) were observed at 30 minutes in the obese group.
   CONCLUSION: Hemodynamic changes after intake of energy drinks in obese subjects indicate that obesity and energy drinks could synergistically induce harmful effects. This finding warrants efforts to caution the obese on intake of energy drinks and timely intervention to motivate changes in life style.

AB Most individuals adjust their caffeine intake according to the objective and subjective effects induced by the methylxanthine. However, to reach the desired effects, the quantity of caffeine consumed varies largely among individuals. It has been known for decades that the metabolism, clearance, and pharmacokinetics of caffeine is affected by many factors such as age, sex and hormones, liver disease, obesity, smoking, and diet. Caffeine also interacts with many medications. All these factors will be reviewed in the present document and discussed in light of the most recent data concerning the genetic variability affecting caffeine levels and effects at the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic levels that both critically drive the level of caffeine consumption. The pharmacokinetics of caffeine are highly variable among individuals due to a polymorphism at the level of the CYP1A2 isoform of cytochrome P450, which metabolizes 95% of the caffeine ingested. Moreover there is a polymorphism at the level of another critical enzyme, N-acetyltransferase 2. At the pharmacodynamic level, there are several polymorphisms at the main brain target of caffeine, the adenosine A2A receptor or ADORA2. Genetic studies, including genome-wide association studies, identified several loci critically involved in caffeine consumption and its consequences on sleep, anxiety, and potentially in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. We start reaching a better picture on how a multiplicity of biologic mechanisms seems to drive the levels of caffeine consumption, although much more knowledge is still required to understand caffeine consumption and effects on body functions.

AB Caffeine and its derivatives have been used, alone and in combination with other phytochemicals, as weight-loss supplements. Caffeine affects several physiological and behavioural aspects of energy balance, including increasing locomotor activity. This study investigates the potential for caffeine to enhance activity thermogenesis and energy expenditure (EE) even when activity level is held constant. To do this, EE and muscle thermogenesis were measured in rats during treadmill walking regimens, with and without caffeine (25 mg/kg, ip). Activity-related EE was significantly increased throughout the treadmill walking protocol. Muscle heat dissipation, on the other hand, was significantly increased by caffeine only at the end of the 25-minute treadmill test. This study demonstrates that caffeine increases the caloric cost of physical activity, compared to the caloric cost of that same physical activity without caffeine, implicating decreased muscle work efficiency. Combined with the known ability of caffeine to increase locomotor activity, the decreased locomotor efficiency imparted by caffeine may further augment the potential for caffeine to enhance caloric expenditure.

AB Context: Eucommia ulmoides Oliver (Eucommiaceae) leaf exhibits beneficial lipid-lowering and anti-obesity effects. However, the mechanisms remain unknown.Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the lipid-lowering effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA)-enriched extract from this plant (CAEF) in human hepatoma HepG2 cells, focusing on cholesterol metabolism.Materials and methods: HepG2 cells were treated with CAEF (10, 20, 25, 40, 60, and 80mg/L), CGA (0.3, 3, 30, 300, and 600mol/L), and simvastatin (0.1, 1, 10, 50, and 100mol/L) for 24 or 48h. The cytotoxicity, Oil red O staining, total cholesterol, and triacylglycerol in supernatants were determined. The mRNA expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism was determined with RT-PCR. The protein expression of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) was examined by immunocytochemistry and western-blot.Results: The IC50 values were 59.2mg/L for CAEF, 335.9mol/L for CGA, and 10.5mol/L for simvastatin. By treating cells with CAEF (25mg/L), CGA (30mol/L), or simvastatin (10mol/L) for 48h, the efflux of total cholesterol and triacylglycerol was increased (CAEF, 4.06- and 31.00-folds; CGA, 2.94- and 2.17-folds; and simvastatin, 3.94- and 24.67-folds), and the cellular lipid droplets were reduced in Oil red O staining. CAEF and CGA increased mRNA expression of ABCA1, CYP7A1, and AMPK2, while CAEF and simvastatin decreased SREBP2. However, their effects on LXR mRNA expression were variable. Importantly, all drugs significantly inhibited protein expression of HMGCR at mRNA and protein levels.Discussion and conclusion: CAEF is a promising dietary supplement to prevent obesity and dyslipidemia and the effects appear to be due, at least in part, to regulating cholesterol metabolism through inhibition of HMGCR in HepG2 cells.

AB Background: Consumers' food production requirements have changed considerably during the last decade. This includes growing interest in the use of aroma compounds to develop functional foods for providing health benefits and reducing chemically synthesized additives. More recently, beyond their flavoring properties, various reports have shown the potential role of volatile compounds in human health, including their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-obesity activities. Thus, investigation into the pharmacological activities of flavor and volatile compounds has been increased. Scope and approach: To our knowledge, no single review article is available that provides an overview of the health benefits and antimicrobial properties of volatile compounds. To address this, here it was aimed to review the current knowledge of the health benefit and antimicrobial properties of volatile compounds.
   Key findings and conclusions: There are many plant or food products with health benefits and antimicrobial activities. However, existing literature indicates that terpenoids, phenolics and alkaloids are among natural taste compounds, which are the most attractive sources in terms of developing new antimicrobial agents and health-promoting ingredients. Future investigation is required to demonstrate key properties of volatiles/non-volatile taste compounds such as synergic actions, organoleptic impacts, process stability and efficacy dosage, particularly in cooperation with different research disciplines.

AB Background and aims: In the general population, habitual coffee consumption is inversely associated with the metabolic syndrome, a syndrome that is rather common also in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, whether coffee intake is beneficially related to the metabolic syndrome also in type 1 diabetes, is not known. We, therefore, studied the potential association between coffee consumption and the metabolic syndrome in a large population of individuals with type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, we investigated whether coffee consumption is associated with insulin resistance (estimated glucose disposal rate, eGDR), kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR), and low-grade chronic inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, hsCRP).
   Methods and results: Data from 1040 participants in the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study were included in these cross-sectional analyses. Metabolic syndrome was assumed if at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors were present: central obesity, high blood pressure, low HDL-cholesterol concentration, high triglyceride concentration, and hyperglycaemia. Subjects were categorized based on self-reported daily coffee intake: non-consumers (<1 cup/d), low (>= 1 cups/d < 3), moderate (>= 3 cups/d < 5), and high coffee consumption (>= 5 cups/d). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, moderate and high coffee consumption was associated with increased odds of the metabolic syndrome. Moreover, any level of coffee consumption was associated with increased risk of the blood pressure-component. An increasing trend was observed in the eGFR with increasing coffee consumption.
   Conclusions: In type 1 diabetes, high coffee intake is associated with the metabolic syndrome, and especially its blood pressure-component. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Caffeine has been proposed to have several beneficial effects on obesity and its related metabolic diseases; however, how caffeine affects adipocyte differentiation has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that caffeine suppressed 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and inhibited the expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP). and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)., two main adipogenic transcription factors. Anti-adipogenic markers, such as preadipocyte secreted factor (Pref)-1 and Kruppel-like factor 2, remained to be expressed in the presence of caffeine. Furthermore, 3T3-L1 cells failed to undergo typical mitotic clonal expansion in the presence of caffeine. Investigation of hormonal signaling revealed that caffeine inhibited the activation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 in a dose-dependent manner, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Our data show that caffeine is an anti-adipogenic bioactive compound involved in the modulation of mitotic clonal expansion during adipocyte differentiation through the AKT/GSK3 pathway.

AB Background: Advanced glycation end-products are a heterogeneous group of molecules that are formed during reactions between reducing sugars and proteins. Advanced glycation end-products are thought to play a role in several diseases, including diabetes mellitus and can be measured non-invasively using skin autofluorescence (AF). The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate associations between skin AF and cardio-metabolic, lifestyle, and dietary factors within a general population.
   Methods: The NQplus study is an ongoing longitudinal study in the surroundings of Wageningen, the Netherlands. In this cross-sectional study, skin AF was measured in 957 participants, aged 20 to 77 years, with the AGE Reader. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between skin AF and the following factors: demographics, adiposity, blood lipids, fasting glucose, HbA(1c), blood pressure, dietary intake, and disease history. Stepwise linear regression was used to identify factors correlating with skin AF.
   Results: In males, skin AF was significantly associated with age, coffee intake, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body fat, full fat dairy, and educational level. In females, significant associations were found with age, coffee intake, HbA(1c), diabetes, and eGFR. In the total population, current smoking was positively associated with skin AF.
   Conclusions: This cross-sectional study in a general population showed that age and coffee intake were associated with skin AF in both males and females. We observed a gender disparity for some of the associations with skin AF, which need to be confirmed by further research. More detailed research is needed to assess the association between skin AF and diet.

AB ObjectiveCaffeine and ephedrine was an effective combination therapy for weight loss until ephedrine was removed from the market due to safety concerns. This study investigated the combination of caffeine and albuterol as a possibly safer alternative to ephedrine.
   MethodsIn a series of experiments using cultured adipocytes, rat models, and humans, the effects of caffeine and albuterol on lipolysis, metabolic rate, food intake, and body composition were evaluated.
   ResultsBoth caffeine and albuterol enhanced lipolysis in cultured adipocytes. Acute treatment of humans with caffeine and/or albuterol increased resting metabolic rate. Longer-term studies of rats revealed a trend for increased metabolic rate with albuterol treatment. There was increased lean mass gain concurrent with decreased fat mass gain with caffeine/albuterol treatment that was greater than albuterol treatment alone.
   ConclusionsIn rats, albuterol with caffeine produced significantly greater increases in lean body mass and reductions in fat mass without changes in food intake after 4-8 weeks of treatment. Since caffeine and albuterol are approved for the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents at the doses tested and change body composition without changing food intake, this combination may deserve further exploration for use in treating pediatric obesity.

AB Catechins and caffeine, which are green tea components, have a slimming effect; however, the combinational effect of fat metabolism in 3T3-L1 cells remains unclear. In the present study, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with catechins and caffeine in combination, and it was found that combination therapy with catechins and caffeine markedly reduced intracellular fat accumulation, mRNA expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein a in the early stage of cell differentiation were significantly reduced, and mRNA expression of fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein expression levels of FAS were down regulated. Noradrenaline-induced lipolysis was enhanced by caffeine, which markedly increased the protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase. These results indicated that combination therapy with catechins and caffeine synergistically inhibited lipid accumulation by regulating the gene and protein expression levels of lipid metabolism-related enzymes. Therefore, catechins and caffeine combination therapy has potential as a functional food that may be used to prevent obesity and lifestyle-associated diseases.

AB Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and caffeine in tea exert anti-obesity effects and induces nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) amelioration. However, previous studies usually performed a high-dose EGCG administration, whereas the insecurity was arisen in recent researches. In this study, we treated obese rats with an elaborate dose40mg/kg EGCG, 20mg/kg caffeine, and the coadministration of them as low dose, which were similar to the daily intake; 160mg/kg EGCG as high dose, which was the maximum safe dose had touched the contentious edge. The results suggested that the coadministration of EGCG and caffeine exerted more remarkable function on suppressing body weight gain, reducing white adipose tissue weight and decreasing the energy intake than single use. This may be due to the variation in serum lipid profile, oxidative stress, and adipose-derived and inflammatory cytokines. The pathological micrographs showed long-term high-fat diets caused severe NAFLD, but it was ameliorated at different levels by all of the administrations. In summary, low dose of EGCG or caffeine only showed a mild effect of anti-obesity and NAFLD amelioration. The coadministration of them could exert a superior curative effect as well as high dose EGCG but no anxiety regarding safety.

AB The current study investigated preventive responses to Houttuynia cordata (HC) standardized extract in obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in mice. High-performance liquid chromatography was carried out to analyze bioactive components in HC. Mice were divided into HFD groups as a control and HFD groups fed with 1 and 4 % of HC supplementation diet. Changes of the body weight of mice, blood biological factors, and histopathological markers were measured. Bioactive components from HC were characterized to contain chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and quercitrin. HC supplementation reduced body weight, glucose, and total cholesterol levels, but it did not affect aspartic acid transaminase, alanine transaminase, or triglyceride amounts in plasma from mice induced by HFD. A 4 % HC supplementation showed a remarkable decrease in the number of large adipocyte in subcutaneous and abdominal adipose tissue. Histopathological evaluation of liver injury induced by HFD was observed to be improved by HC supplementation, leading to attenuated levels of cytoplasmic vacuolation of hepatocytes. From these results, we explored that standardized extract of HC could be a potential natural product to be directly associated with the control of weight.

AB To elucidate the anorexigenic action and inhibitory effect of fat accumulation by epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and caffeine, including the optimal combination ratio and mechanism, fifteen diets with several concentrations of EGCG and/or caffeine were administered to mice for eight weeks. The 0.1% EGCG + 0.1% caffeine group showed the strongest suppression of food intake and a remarkable reduction of body weight and fat accumulation; therefore, the ratio was determined to be the optimal combination ratio. Moreover, serum glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level and hypothalamic gene expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) were promoted by 0.1% EGCG + 0.1% caffeine. In conclusion, the combined treatment of 0.1% EGCG + 0.1% caffeine induces not only suppression of fat accumulation but also strong anorexigenic action in mice. The anorexigenic effect may be brought about via inhibiting gastric motility by GLP-1 and upregulating POMC in the hypothalamus.

AB Obesity is a serious health problem in adults and children worldwide. However, the basic strategies for the management of obesity (diet, exercise, drugs and surgery) have limitations and side effects. Therefore, many researchers have sought to identify bioactive components in food. Tea and coffee are the most frequently consumed beverages in the whole world. Their health benefits have been studied for decades, especially those of green tea. The anti-obesity effect of tea and coffee has been studied for at least ten years. The results have shown decreased lipid accumulation in cells via the regulation of the cell cycle during adipogenesis, changes in transcription factors and lipogenesis-related proteins in the adipose tissue of animal models, and decreased body weight and visceral fat in humans. Tea and coffee also influence the gut microbiota in obese animals and humans. Although the anti-obesity mechanism of tea and coffee still needs further clarification, they may have potential as a new strategy to prevent or treat obesity.

AB Aster spathulifolius Maxim (AS), a perennial herb of the genus Aster within the family Asteraceae, induced weight loss in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. We hypothesized that AS could also reduce body weight in obese humans. Therefore, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Korea to evaluate the effect of AS extract (ASE) on body weight and fat mass and its safety in obese humans. Forty-four obese participants (body mass index [BMI], 25-30 kg/m(2)) aged >= 20 years were randomly assigned to the placebo or ASE group (700 mg/d of ASE) and were instructed to take a once-daily pill for 12 weeks. Weight, BMI, waist circumference, fat mass (measured using bioimpedance, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and computed tomography), and laboratory tests were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks. Body weight significantly decreased after 12 weeks of treatment in the ASE group (placebo vs ASE: -0.08 +/- 2.11 kg vs -3.30 +/- 3.15 kg, P < .05), and so did body fat mass (placebo vs ASE; bioimpedance method: -0.51 +/- 1.89 kg vs -2.38 +/- 2.30 kg, P < .05; dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry: 0.38 +/- 1.59 kg vs -2.26 +/- 2.37 kg, P < .05). Changes in lipid profiles, fasting plasma glucose, and hemoglobin A1c did not differ between the 2 groups. No drug-related adverse events were observed during the study. In conclusion, ASE significantly decreases body weight and fat mass in obese humans, suggesting that ASE may be a potential therapeutic candidate for reducing obesity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: A retrospective chart review was conducted to explore the effect of Gambisan, a granular extract of novel herbal medicine, for short-term (<= 16 weeks) weight loss in adults who are overweight and those with obesity. Methods: Outpatients of Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital (Seoul, Korea) who took Gambisan and underwent bioelectric impedance analysis were selected (Jan 2011 to Dec 2015); their electronic medical records and clinical charts were retrospectively reviewed. The effectiveness of Gambisan was primarily evaluated by comparing body weight (BW) at baseline and endpoint, using paired t tests; the safety of Gambisan was evaluated on the basis of adverse events (AEs) experienced by patients. Results: Two hundred five patients were included in this study. The study population exhibited a significant reduction in BW (73.69 +/- 14.49 kg to 69.01 +/- 13.20 kg, P < .001) as well as percentage body fat (37.38 +/- 5.38% to 34.50 +/- 5.83%, P < .001). Moreover, 111 (54.1%) patients achieved modest weight loss (>= 5%), while 35 (17.1%) achieved >= 10% weight loss. Furthermore, Gambisan induced significant reduction of BW in all subgroups (body mass index, sex, prescribed duration, and dosage). Among 139 patients with available data, 79 (56.8%) reported loss-of-appetite. In addition, 120 (mostly mild) AEs were reported in 69 (49.6%) patients, and the most frequent AEs were nausea, palpitation, and insomnia. Discussion: Despite limitations in interpreting the results of this retrospective medical record review, Gambisan induced statistically and clinically meaningful weight loss with a tolerable level of AEs. Based on the findings of this review, further well-designed clinical trials are warranted.

AB Caffeine is a psychostimulant commonly consumed with high levels of sugar. The increased availability of highly caffeinated, high sugar energy drinks could put some consumers at risk of being exposed to high doses of caffeine and sugar. Notably, research that has examined the consequences of this combination is limited. Here, we explored the effect of chronic exposure to caffeine and/or sugar on behavior and protein levels in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of rats. The OFC brain region has been implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions, including obesity and addiction behaviors. Adultmale Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 26 days with control, caffeine (0.6 g/L), 10% sugar, or combination of both. Locomotor behavior was measured on the first and last day of treatment, then 1 week after treatment. Two hours following final behavioral testing, brains were rapidly removed and prepared for proteomic analysis of the OFC. Label-free quantitative shotgun analysis revealed that 21, 12, and 23% of proteins identified in the OFC were differentially expressed by sugar and/or caffeine. The results demonstrate that the intake of high levels of sugar and/or low to moderate levels of caffeine has different behavioral consequences. Moreover, each treatment results in a unique proteomic profile with different implications for neural health.

AB Obesity is associated with higher risks of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Green tea, rich in polyphenolic compounds such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epigallocatechin (EGC), has been shown to display anti-obesity effects. Houttuynia cordata leaves have also been shown to exhibit anti-obesity effects due to their chlorogenic acid content. Lactic acid bacteria are able to increase the production of polyphenolic compounds. This study aims to develop a novel anti-obesity fermentation product by combining H. cordata leaf tea with green tea, using Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101 (NTU 101) for fermentation due to the advantages of bioconverting the polyphenolic compounds. The regulation of adipogenesis factors and the anti-obesity effect of the NTU 101-fermented tea were evaluated in an in vitro 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte model and an in vivo obese rat model, respectively. The results show that the NTU 101-fermented tea, which contained higher EGCG, EGC, and chlorogenic acid levels than unfermented tea, was able to inhibit the lipogenesis of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes by the stimulation of lipolysis. Furthermore, the body weight gain, body fat pad, and feeding efficiency of obese rats, induced with a high fat diet, were decreased by the oral administration of NTU 101-fermented tea. The significant anti-obesity effect was probably due to lipolysis. However, NTU 101 bacteria cells and EGCG may also act as functional ingredients to contribute to the anti-obesity effects of NTU 101-fermented products.

AB We examined the effect of a lactate-based compound containing caffeine with voluntary running exercise on fat loss and metabolic improvement in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats. The rats treated with exercise training (Ex) and the compound (i.e., 1000 mg/kg body weight of sodium lactate and 36 mg/kg body weight of caffeine) with exercise training (ExLC) for 5 weeks showed decreased epididymal and scapular fat mass compared to the sedentary (S) rats, while LC rats displayed significantly decreased scapular fat mass compared to the Ex rats. The area under the curve for the LC rats during an oral glucose tolerance test was significantly lower compared with the S and Ex rats. Thus, administration of a lactate-based compound containing caffeine can effectively decrease fat mass and improve glucose tolerance even with low volume exercise training in DIO rats.

AB Purpose To investigate the mechanistic effects of combined exposure to caffeine and catechins on lipid metabolism in mice.
   Methods Seventy mice were randomly assigned to seven groups and fed diets containing varying doses of caffeine and catechins for 24 weeks. Body weight gain, intraperitoneal adipose tissue (IPAT) weight, serum biochemical parameters, and enzymatic activities, mRNA and protein expression levels of lipid metabolism-related enzymes in the liver and IPAT were analyzed.
   Results Following administration of caffeine and catechins, body weight gain, IPAT weight, serum and liver concentrations of total cholesterol and triglyceride were markedly reduced. Lipase activities, including that of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acyl-CoA oxidase, carnitine acyltransferase, adipose triglyceride lipase, and hormone-sensitive lipase, were significantly upregulated; however, fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity in the liver was suppressed. Combined exposure to caffeine and catechins significantly upregulated mRNA and protein expression levels of lipases while downregulating FAS mRNA expression and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2.
   Conclusions The combination of caffeine and catechins regulated the enzymatic activities, mRNA, and protein expression levels of lipid metabolism-related enzymes, resulting in suppression of body weight gain and IPAT weight in mice, potentially through activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. This study indicates that chronic intake of both caffeine and catechins can synergistically contribute to prevention of obesity and lifestyle-related diseases.

AB PurposeHabitual coffee consumption has been associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Since these diseases are main determinants of functional limitations, we have tested the hypothesis that coffee intake is associated with lower risk of physical function impairment, frailty and disability in older adults. We focused on women and those with obesity, hypertension or type 2 diabetes because they are at higher risk of functional limitations.MethodsProspective study with 3289 individuals60years from the Seniors-ENRICA cohort. In 2008-2010 coffee consumption was measured through a validated dietary history. Participants were followed up until 2015 to ascertain incident impaired physical function, frailty and disability, assessed by both self-report and objective measures.ResultsCompared with non-drinking coffee, consumption of 2 cups of coffee/day was associated with lower risk of impaired agility in women (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.97, P trend 0.04) and in those with obesity (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.40-0.90, P trend 0.04). Intake of 2 cups of coffee/day was also linked to reduced risk of impaired mobility in women (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.46-0.95, P trend 0.02) and among individuals with hypertension (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.48-1.00, P trend 0.05). Moreover, among subjects with diabetes, those who consumed2 cups/day had lower risk of disability in activities of daily living (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.76, P trend 0.01).ConclusionsIn older people, habitual coffee consumption was not associated with increased risk of functional impairment, and it might even be beneficial in women and those with hypertension, obesity or diabetes.

AB Rationale Akebiae Fructus (AF) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with antiphlogistic, analgesic, antineoplastic, diuretic, antirheumatic, antidepressant and antiobesity activities. Identification of chemical constituents from AF is helpful to discover the potential active ingredients and to control its quality. Methods The four-step filtering strategy was as follows: (1) To extract the accurate mass by the different adduct ions. (2) To screen different types of the compounds using diagnostic ions. (3) By characteristic ion filtering, to confirm the substituted position and the sugar chain numbers. (4) Based on the neutral loss (NL), to identify the type of monosaccharide and the compositions of sugar chains of triterpenoid saponins and the structure of CGAs. Results A total of 94 compounds (85 triterpenoid saponins, 9 chlorogenic acids) were unambiguously or reasonably identified. Fifty constituents were discovered for the first time from AF. Nine types of triterpenoid saponins, including akebonoic acid (type I), norhederagenin (type II), oleanolic acid (type III), 2 alpha,3 beta-dihydroxy-23-oxo-30-norolean-12,20(21)-dien-28-oic acid (type IV), gypsogenin (type V), norarjunolic acid (type VI), hederagenin (type VII), 2 alpha,3 beta-dihydroxy-23-oxo-olean-12-en-28-oic acid (type VIII), arjunolic acid (type IX), and two types of chlorogenic acid (mono-CQA and di-CQA), were identified in AF. Conclusions An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry with MSE (UPLC-QTOF-MSE) analysis with four-step filtering strategy was established and successfully applied to identify the chemical constituents of AF which can provide chemical support for further research and play an important role in the quality control of AF.

AB This post hoc pooled analysis assessed the effectiveness of green tea catechins (GTC) to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) associated with abdominal fat reduction, because previous findings are unclear. Data were pooled from six human trials (n=921, 505 men) comparing the effects of GTC-containing beverages (540-588 mg GTC/beverage) and a placebo beverage. Outcome measures were abdominal fat [total fat area (TFA), visceral fat area (VFA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA)], and MetS risk. We estimated mean changes from baseline and calculated confidence intervals (CI) to assess reductions in abdominal fat accumulation and MetS improvement. Subclass analyses were performed by classifying subjects as Pre-MetS or MetS at trial initiation. Additional subclass analyses were performed with Pre-MetS and MetS subjects further stratified according to whether GTC intake reduced TFA, VFA, or SFA. Consumption of GTC-containing beverages for 12 weeks significantly reduced TFA (-17.7cm(2), 95%CI: -20.9 to -14.4), VFA (-7.5cm(2), 95%CI: -9.3 to -5.7), SFA (-10.2cm(2), 95%CI: -12.5 to -7.8), body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference; and improved blood pressure. Subclass analyses of Pre-MetS and MetS subjects showed improved MetS in the GTC group [odds ratio (OR), 1.67; 95%CI: 1.08-2.57]. The ORs for improved MetS in the TFA- and VFA-reduced groups were 2.79 (95%CI: 1.28-6.09) and 4.36 (95%CI: 2.03-9.39), respectively. Continual consumption of GTC-containing beverages reduced abdominal fat and improved MetS, suggesting its potential to prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Additional large-scale intervention trials are needed to evaluate the effects of GTC on the risk of MetS in high-risk populations. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Cafeteria diet (CAF) mimics human Western diet and has been used in animal models to study obesity. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that our CAF model induces metabolic disorder related to obesity and affects recognition memory in Wistar rats. We also compared the intake of two different soft drinks, as part of the CAF, on recognition memory. Our results demonstrate that CAF-fed rats increased weight gain and visceral adiposity, and exhibited hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, high leptin and low insulin plasma levels. Moreover, CAF animals showed higher lipid peroxidation in the liver and developed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Surprisingly, the group fed with cola-based soft drinks presented an improvement in recognition memory, whereas animals fed with orange-based soft drinks showed worse performance in this task. Our data indicates that CAF induces obesity and affects recognition memory, but the composition of the diet interfere when the neurological function is evaluated.

AB Tea possesses many bioactive components including polyphenols, theanine and caffeine. Inhibitory effect of these components on the various enzymes involved in some chronic diseases was reviewed in this study. Many studies revealed that anti-obesity of tea was mainly ascribed to the polyphenols which could inhibit the activity of the enzymes related to diet metabolism such as -amylase, -glucosidase and lipase. Inhibitory effect of catechins and caffeine against - and -secretase, acetylcholinesterase, protein kinase C and histone deacetylase might be responsible for the prevention from nervous system diseases. Cytochrome P450 enzymes, cytosolic sulfotransferases, cyclooxygenase-2 and phosphoinositide-3-kinase could be efficiently suppressed by catechins, which would decrease the risk of cancer initiation and proliferation; theanine could lower the activity of some anticarcinogen-activated enzymes and alleviate the adverse effect of cancer cure. Catechins and caffeine exhibited significant inhibition against the matrix metalloproteinases, histidine decarboxylase and many kinases related to inflammation. Thus, catechins, theanine and caffeine might be employed as inhibitors of the enzymes associated with these chronic diseases.

AB Protocatechuic acid (PC), chlorogenic acid (CA), and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (K-O-R), isolated from the Solidago virgaurea subsp. gigantea (SV) extract, were quickly and efficiently separated using HPLC. Our chromatographic method was found to effectively separate PC, CA, and K-O-R at retention times of 5.36, 8.22, and 17.04 min, respectively. Linearity of PC, CA, and K-O-R was found to be in the range of 4.85-485.00, 47.5-1900.00, and 8.50-850.00 mu g/ml. Recoveries ranged between 101.32 and 103.30%, 95.82 and 100.25%, and 96.18 and 99.37%, for PC, CA, and K-O-R, respectively. The antiadipogenesis activity of SV extracts collected from five different months and from seven different regions was evaluated using an Oil Red O staining assay in 3T3-L1 cells. Extract from SV collected in April from the Ulleung Island produced over 106.89% inhibition of adipogenesis without cytotoxicity at 50 mu g/ml. This extract had a high amount of PC and K-O-R. The developed HPLC method was found to be fast, accurate, precise, and reproducible and could be applied to qualitative and quantitative analysis of three bioactive compounds in SV extracts. The SV extract collected in April from Ulleung Island can be used as a functional food ingredient preventing obesity.

AB Adipocytes are important players in metabolic health and disease, and disruption of adipocyte development or function contributes to metabolic dysregulation. Hence, adipocytes are significant targets for therapeutic intervention in obesity and metabolic syndrome. Plants have long been sources for bioactive compounds and drugs. In previous studies, we screened botanical extracts for effects on adipogenesis in vitro and discovered that an ethanolic extract of Artemisia scoparia (SCO) could promote adipocyte differentiation. To follow up on these studies, we have used various separation methods to identify the compound(s) responsible for SCO's adipogenic properties. Fractions and subfractions of SCO were tested for effects on lipid accumulation and adipogenic gene expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fractions were also analyzed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS), and resulting peakswere putatively identified through high resolution, highmass accuracy mass spectrometry, literature data, and available natural products databases. The inactive fractions contained mostly quercetin derivatives and chlorogenates, including chlorogenic acid and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, which had no effects on adipogenesis when tested individually, thus ruling them out as pro-adipogenic bioactives in SCO. Based on these studies we have putatively identified the principal constituents in SCO fractions and subfractions that promoted adipocyte development and fat cell gene expression as prenylated coumaric acids, coumarin monoterpene ethers, 6-demethoxycapillarisin and two polymethoxyflavones.

AB BackgroundHigher dietary intake of fibers and coffee, but lower red meat intake is associated with reduced risk for type 2 diabetes in epidemiological studies. We hypothesized that a calorie-restricted diet, which is high in fiber and coffee, but free of red meat, improves beta-cell function in patients with T2D.MethodsIn a randomized parallel-group pilot trial, obese type 2 diabetes patients were randomly allocated to consume either a diet high in cereal fiber and coffee, but free of red meat (n=17) (L-RISK) or a diet low in fiber, free of coffee but high in red meat (n=20) (H-RISK) for 8weeks. Insulin secretion was assessed from glucagon stimulation tests (GST) and mixed-meal tolerance tests (MMTT) before and after dietary intervention.ResultsBoth diets resulted in comparable reduction of fasting concentrations of insulin (H-RISK -28% vs. L-RISK -32%, bothp<0.01), C-peptide (H-RISK -26% vs. L-RISK -30%, bothp<0.01) and blood glucose (H-RISK -6.8%, p<0.05 vs. L-RISK -10%, p<0.01). Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) secretion increased by 24% after 8weeks in the L-RISK only (p<0.01). However, GST and MMTT showed no differences in insulin secretion after intervention.ConclusionsCalorie restriction independent of the intake of fiber, coffee or meat failed to improve beta-cell function, but improved GIP secretion in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.Trial registrationRegistration at Clinicaltrials.gov, Identifier number: NCT01409330, Registered 4 August 2011 - Retrospectively registered.

AB Epidemiological studies have revealed that obesity and being overweight are associated with increased cancer risk. Adipose tissue is regarded as an endocrine organ that secretes proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are related to the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, adipocytes from 3T3-L1 cells were induced and stained with Oil Red O, which revealed marked intracellular lipid accumulation. Adding 15% conditioned medium (CM) from adipogenic -differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, which contained adipocyte-derived factors, to a culture medium of HepG2 cells was discovered to promote cell proliferation by a factor of up to 1.3 compared with the control. Mulberry leaf extract (MLE), with major components including chlorogenic acid and neochlorogenic acid, was revealed to inhibit CM-promoted HepG2 cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect of MLE on the proliferation of the signal network was evaluated. Expression of the CM-activated I kappa B/NF kappa B, STAT3, and Akt/mTOR pathways were reduced when MLE was administered. Although adipocyte-derived factors are complex, administrating anti-TNF-alpha and anti-IL-6 revealed that MLE blocks signal activation promoted by TNF-a and IL-6. Taken together, these results demonstrated that MLE targets the proliferation signal pathway of the inflammatory response of adipocytes in HCC and could be to prevent obesity-mediated liver cancer.

AB Obesity is a central health issue due to its epidemic prevalence and its association with type 2 diabetes and other comorbidities. Obesity is not just being overweight. It is a metabolic disorder due to the accumulation of excess dietary calories into visceral fat and the release of high concentrations of free fatty acids into various organs. It represents a state of chronic oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation whose intermediary molecules may include leptin, adiponectin and cytokines. It may progress to hyperglycemia, leading to type 2 diabetes. Whether or not dietary antioxidant supplements are useful in the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes is discussed in this review. Only the benefits for obesity and diabetes are examined here. Other health benefits of antioxidants are not considered. There are difficulties in comparing studies in this field because they differ in the time frame, participants' ethnicity, administration of antioxidant supplements, and even in how obesity was measured. However, the literature presents reasonable evidence for marginal benefits of supplementation with zinc, lipoic acid, carnitine, cinnamon, green tea, and possibly vitamin C plus E, although the evidence is much weaker for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, green coffee, resveratrol, or lycopene. Overall, antioxidant supplements are not a panacea to compensate for a fast-food and video-game way of living, but antioxidant-rich foods are recommended as part of the lifestyle. Such antioxidant foods are commonly available. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the beverage portion size consumed and to evaluate their association with excess weight in Brazil.
   METHODS: We used data from the National Dietary Survey, which included individuals with two days of food record aged over 20 years (n = 24,527 individuals). The beverages were categorized into six groups: soft drink, 100% fruit juice, fruit drink, alcoholic beverage, milk, and coffee or tea. We estimated the average portion consumed for each group and we evaluated, using linear regression, the association between portion size per group and the variables of age, sex, income, and nutritional status. We tested the association between portion size and excess weight using Poisson regression, adjusted for age, sex, income, and total energy intake.
   RESULTS: The most frequently consumed beverages in Brazil were coffee and tea, followed by 100% fruit juices, soft drinks, and milk. Alcoholic beverages presented the highest average in the portion size consumed, followed by soft drinks, 100% fruit juice, fruit drink, and milk. Portion size showed positive association with excess weight only in the soft drink (PR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.27) and alcoholic beverage groups (PR = 1.20, 95% CI, 1.11-1.29), regardless of age, sex, income, and total energy intake.
   CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholic beverages and soft drinks presented the highest averages in portion size and positive association with excess weight. Public health interventions should address the issue of portion sizes offered to consumers by discouraging the consumption of large portions, especially sweetened and low nutritional beverages.

AB BackgroundGreen tea extract (GTE) may be involved in a favourable post-prandial response to high-carbohydrate meals. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype may modify these effects. We examined the acute effects of GTE supplementation on the post-prandial response to a high-carbohydrate meal by assessing appetite-associated hormones and glucose homeostasis marker concentrations in women who consumed 843mg of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) or placebo capsules for 11-12months.
   MethodsSixty Caucasian post-menopausal women (body mass index25.0kgm(-2)) were included in a randomised, double-blind feeding study. GTE was consumed with a breakfast meal [2784.0kJ (665.4kcal); 67.2% carbohydrate]. Blood samples were drawn pre-meal, post-meal, and every 30min for 4h. Participants completed six satiety questionnaires.
   ResultsPlasma leptin, ghrelin and adiponectin did not differ between GTE and placebo at any time point; COMT genotype did not modify these results. Participants randomised to GTE with the high-activity form of COMT (GTE-high COMT) had higher insulin concentrations at time 0, 0.5 and 1.0h post-meal compared to all COMT groups randomised to placebo. Insulin remained higher in the GTE-high COMT group at 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5h compared to Placebo-low COMT (P<0.02). GTE-high COMT had higher insulin concentrations at times 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0h compared to the GTE-low COMT (P0.04). Area under the curve measurements of satiety did not differ between GTE and placebo.
   ConclusionsGTE supplementation and COMT genotype did not alter acute post-prandial responses of leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin or satiety, although it may be involved in post-meal insulinaemic response of overweight and obese post-menopausal women.

AB Rosiglitazone (RG) is a well-known activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR) and used to treat hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes; however, its clinical application has been confounded by adverse side effects. Here, we assessed the roles of chlorogenic acid (CGA), a phenolic secondary metabolite found in many fruits and vegetables, on the differentiation and lipolysis of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The results showed that CGA promoted differentiation in vitro according to oil red O staining and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. As a potential molecular mechanism, CGA downregulated mRNA levels of the adipocyte differentiation-inhibitor gene Pref1 and upregulated those of major adipogenic transcriptional factors (Cebpb and Srebp1). Additionally, CGA upregulated the expression of the differentiation-related transcriptional factor PPAR2 at both the mRNA and protein levels. However, following CGA intervention, the accumulation of intracellular triacylglycerides following preadipocyte differentiation was significantly lower than that in the RG group. Consistent with this, our data indicated that CGA treatment significantly upregulated the expression of lipogenic pathway-related genes Plin and Srebp1 during the differentiation stage, although the influence of CGA was weaker than that of RG. Notably, CGA upregulated the expression of the lipolysis-related gene Hsl, whereas it did not increase the expression of the lipid synthesis-related gene Dgat1. These results demonstrated that CGA might function as a potential PPAR agonist similar to RG; however, the impact of CGA on lipolysis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differed from that of RG.

AB Chlorogenic acids (CGA) are the most abundant polyphenols in coffee. Continuous consumption of CGA reduces body fat and body weight. Since energy metabolism and sleep are controlled by common regulatory factors, consumption of CGA might modulate sleep. Lack of sleep has been identified as a risk factor for obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ingesting CGA over 5 d on energy metabolism and sleep quality in humans. A total of nine healthy subjects (four male and five female) completed a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over intervention study. Subjects consumed a test beverage containing 0 or 600 mg of CGA for 5 d. On the fifth night, subjects stayed in a whole-room metabolic chamber to measure energy metabolism; sleep was evaluated using polysomnographic recording. It was found that CGA shortened sleep latency (9 ((SEM) 2) v. 16 ((SEM) 4) min, P< 0.05) compared with the control, whereas no effect on sleep architecture, such as slow-wave sleep, rapid eye movement or waking after sleep onset, was observed. Indirect calorimetry revealed that consumption of CGA increased fat oxidation (510 ((SEM) 84) kJ/8 h (122 ((SEM) 20) kcal/8 h) v. 331 ((SEM) 79) kJ/8 h (81 ((SEM) 19) kcal/8 h), P < 0.05) but did not affect energy expenditure during sleep. Consumption of CGA enhanced parasympathetic activity assessed from heart-rate variability during sleep (999 ((SEM) 77) v. 919 ((SEM) 54), P< 0.05). A period of 5-d CGA consumption significantly increased fat oxidation during sleep, suggesting that beverages containing CGA may be beneficial to reduce body fat and prevent obesity. Consumption of CGA shortened sleep latency and did not adversely affect sleep quality.

AB BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate the profiles of bioactive components in roasted Lycium chinense leaves (LCLs) and its in vitro anti-obesity activity after digestion processes.
   ResultsChlorogenic acid, kaempferol-3-sophoroside-7-glucoside, kaempferol-3-sophoroside, and kaempferol-3-glucoside were discovered as bioactive components in various ratios of ethanol (EtOH) extract in LCLs by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrophotometry (UPLC-ESI-MS). The roasting process followed by a 30% EtOH extraction tended to decrease the content of chlorogenic acid and kaempferol-3-glucoside, and enhanced the content of kaempferol-3-sophoroside-7-glucoside. It effectively inhibited pancreatic lipase activity by 62.504.81%, which was approximately 1.71 percentage points higher than that of the dried-nonroasted LCL extract (60.79 +/- 3.75%). Its bioaccessible fraction obtained from in vitro digestion significantly and dose dependently reduced intracellular lipid accumulation by adipocyte 3T3-L1 compared with a 30% EtOH extraction. At a concentration of 200 mu gmL(-1), it inhibited lipid accumulation up to 29.55% in 3T3-L1 cells, which indicated that human digestive enzymes converted kaempferol-3-sophoroside-7-glucoside to kaempferol metabolites that have anti-obesity effects.
   ConclusionThis study suggests that the profiling of bioactive components by processing methods and a bioaccessible fraction could be crucial to improve the bioactivity of LCLs, and potentially be a natural anti-obesity ingredient after oral intake. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) are thought to play an important role in weight gain. We examined the relationship between the intake of caloric and noncaloric beverages (SSB and water) and the nutritional status of children. In 2014, we randomly selected 16 public health clinics in four cities of Northwest Argentina and conducted a survey among mothers of children 0-6 years of age. Children's beverage intake was ascertained by 24-h dietary recall provided by the mothers. Children's weight and height measures were obtained from clinic's registries. We calculated the body mass index using the International Obesity Task Force standards. The analysis included 562 children 25 months to 6 years of age with normal or above normal nutritional status. Children's beverage consumption was as follows, water 81.8%, carbonated soft drinks (CSD) 49.7%, coffee/tea/cocoa 44.0%, artificial fruit drinks 35.6%, flavored water 17.9%, natural fruit juice 14.5%. In multivariate logistic regression models the likelihood of being obese v. being overweight or having normal weight doubled with an intake of one to five glasses of CSD (OR = 2.2) and increased by more than three-fold with an intake of more than five glasses (OR = 3.5). Drinking more than five glasses of water decreased the likelihood of being obese by less than half (OR = 0.3). The percentage of children drinking more than five glasses of other beverages was low (3.3-0.9%) and regression models did not yield significant results. The study contributed evidence for reducing children's CSD intake and for promoting water consumption, together with the implementation of comprehensive regulatory public health policies.

AB The use of biocompounds as agents with potential anti-obesity effects might be a feasible alternative to the prescription of traditional drugs in the near future. The goal of the present study was to screen five different compounds in relation to their ability to prevent body weight gain and ameliorate obesity-associated metabolic impairments, namely insulin resistance. For this purpose, seventy Wistar rats were randomly assigned into seven experimental groups. A standard diet-fed control group (control, n=10); a high-fat, high-sucrose diet-fed group (BPS, n=10) and five experimental groups which were fed the I-IFS diet supplemented with one of the following biocompounds; curcumin (100 mg/kg bw, n=10), chlorogenic acid (50 mg/kg bw, n=10), coumaric acid (100 mg/kg bw, n=10), naringin (100 mg/kg bw, n=10) and leucine (1 % of diet, n=10). These results confirm the effectiveness of all the compounds to reduce significantly food efficiency, despite the significant higher food intake. Moreover, visceral fat mass percentage was significantly decreased after naringin and coumaric acid supplementation. In fact, this finding might be related to the considerable amelioration of HOMA-IR index detected in naringin-treated animals. A significant reduction in serum insulin levels and an improvement in the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and AUC were found in leucine- and coumaric acid-treated rats, respectively. In summary, the tested biocompounds, particularly naringin, coumaric acid and leucine, showed potential benefits in the prevention of obesity-related complications in rats, at least at the proved doses.

AB Green tea (GT) has various health effects, including anti-obesity properties. However, the multiple molecular mechanisms of the effects have not been fully determined. The aim of this study was to elucidate the anti-obesity effects of GT via the analysis of its metabolic and transcriptional responses based on RNA-seq profiles. C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal, high-fat (60% energy as fat), or high-fat + 0.25% (w/w) GT diet for 12 weeks. The GT extract ameliorated obesity, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. GT supplementation resulted in body weight gain reduction than mice fed high-fat through enhanced energy expenditure, and reduced adiposity. The transcriptome profiles of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) suggested that GT augments transcriptional responses to the degradation of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), as well as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which suggests enhanced energy homeostasis. Our findings provide some significant insights into the effects of GT for the prevention of obesity and its comorbidities. We demonstrated that the GT extract contributed to the regulation of systemic metabolic homeostasis via transcriptional responses to not only lipid and glucose metabolism, but also amino acid metabolism via BCAA degradation in the adipose tissue of DIO mice.

AB Background: Obesity affects 18% of U. S. children. In a recent report, maternal consumption of >= 150 mg of caffeine per day during pregnancy was associated with increased odds for obesity in the offspring (odds ratio = 2.1 [95% confidence interval = 1.2-3.5]). If this association was causal, a considerable fraction of childhood obesity might be prevented by reduction of caffeine intake in pregnancy.
   Methods: We studied 1986 mother-child pairs who were controls from a case-control study of caffeine metabolites and spontaneous abortion nested within the Collaborative Perinatal Project. Women were pregnant during 1959-1966, and children were followed with visits at 48 and/or 84 months of age, when height and weight were measured according to a standardized protocol. Serum was drawn at <20 and >= 26 weeks' gestation and assayed for paraxanthine (caffeine's primary metabolite) by high-performance liquid chromatography. Relative risks of obesity (body mass index >= 95th percentile for age and sex) were estimated by log-binomial or Poisson regression and adjusted for maternal age, race, education, smoking, prepregnant weight, diabetes in pregnancy, and gestational age at blood draw.
   Results: Obesity prevalence was 11.7% at 48 months and 6.5% at 84 months. Associations of maternal serum paraxanthine and child obesity were nonlinear, and adjustment reduced the magnitude of all associations. The maximum relative risk (approximately 1.4) was for the association of paraxanthine drawn at <20 weeks with obesity at ages 48 and 84 months.
   Conclusion: This study does not support an increased risk of childhood obesity with increasing maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy.

AB Several studies have suggested that flavanols may have antiobesity effects; however, those effects clearly depend on the experimental conditions. In a previous study, we found that a single acute dose of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) has satiating effects. We therefore hypothesise that satiating doses of GSPE could be used to reduce body weight gain, and our present objective was to define the most effective dose.
   We assayed two GSPE doses in aged male Wistar rats. First we performed a subchronic (8-day) treatment by intragastric administration, which was repeated after a washout period. We measured body weight, energy intake and faeces composition; we performed indirect calorimetry; and we analysed the mRNA expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism to determine the target tissue for the GSPE.
   We observed that 0.5 g GSPE/kg BW significantly reduced food intake and thus the amount of energy absorbed. This dosage also increased lipid oxidation in subcutaneous adipose tissue, thus causing a higher total energy expenditure. These combined effects caused a decrease in body weight. Conversely, 1 g GSPE/kg BW, which also reduced energy absorption after the first treatment, had a rebound effect on body weight gain which resulted in a lower response to the proanthocyanidin extract. That is, after the second treatment, the GSPE did not reduce the energy absorbed or modify energy expenditure and body weight.
   GSPE at a dose of 0.5 g/kg can reduce body weight by limiting food intake and activating energy expenditure in subcutaneous adipose tissue.

AB Youcha is a novel tea drink from the northeast of Guangxi. This study aimed to investigate the hypolipidemic properties of Youcha in high-fat induced hyperlipidemic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. After designing the model, rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 10): normal diet (NMD) group, high-fat diet (HFD) group, Xuezhikang (120 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) (HFD+P) group and Youcha (150, 750 or 1500 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) (HFD+L, HFD+M or HFD+H) groups. Youcha comprises tea polyphenols (1.51 g per 100 g), caffeine (34.80 mg per 100 g) and other functional compounds. To evaluate the lipid-lowering effects of Youcha, weight of the body, liver and fat, fat index, lipid metabolism, antioxidant properties and liver damage indices were examined. In addition, the activities of some enzymes in serum and liver tissue were examined to preliminarily study their possible mechanism. The results reveal that Youcha tends to reduce body weight, liver weight, fat index, total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) contents, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), atherogenic index (AI), malondialdehyde (MDA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) relative to the HFD group. The hypolipidemic effect was partly due to the regulation of fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and lipase (LPS) rather than lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to decrease TG markedly. These findings suggest that Youcha could be potentially used to remedy hyperlipidemia and is hence worthy of promotion as a tea drink.

DE Energy drinks; Sugar; Island of Ireland; Obesity
ID SWEETENED BEVERAGES; WEIGHT-GAIN; CONSUMPTION; CHILDREN
AB Objective: To describe the caffeine and sugar content of all energy drinks available on the island of Ireland.
   Design: Two retail outlets were selected from each of: multinational, convenience and discount stores in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and all available single-serve energy drinks were purchased. The cross-sectional survey was conducted in February 2015 and brand name, price, volume, caffeine and sugar content were recorded for each product. Descriptive analysis was performed.
   Results: Seventy-eight products were identified on the island of Ireland (regular, n 59; diet/sugar-free/light, n 19). Caffeine and sugar content was in the range of 14-35 mg and 2.9-15.6 g per 100 ml, respectively. Mean caffeine content of 102.2mg per serving represents 25.6% of the maximum intake advised for adults by the European Food Safety Authority. Per serving, mean sugar content of regular energy drinks was 37 g. This exceeds WHO recommendations for maximum daily sugar intake of <5% of total energy intake (25 g for adults consuming 8368 kJ (2000 kcal) diet). If displaying front-of-pack labelling, fifty-seven of the fifty-nine regular energy drinks would receive a Food Standards Agency 'red' colour-coded label for sugar.
   Conclusions: Energy drinks are freely available on the island of Ireland and all products surveyed can be defined as highly caffeinated products. This has potential health issues particularly for children and adolescents where safe limits of caffeine have not been determined. Energy drinks surveyed also contained high levels of sugar and could potentially contribute to weight gain and adverse dental health effects.

AB Objective
   Estimate the intake of phenolic compounds by the Brazilian population.
   Methods
   To estimate the average per capita food consumption, micro data from the National Dietary Survey and from the Household Budget Survey from 2008 to 2009 was analyzed. The phenolic content in food was estimated from the base of Phenol-Explorer. It was chosen according to compatibility and variety of food items and usual method of preparation.
   Results
   The Brazilian population consumed, on average, 460.15 mg/day of total phenolic compounds, derived mainly from beverages (48.9%), especially coffee and legumes (19.5%). Since this analysis of classes of phenolics it was possible to observe an intake of 314 mg/day of phenolic acids, 138.92 mg/day of flavonoids and 7.16 mg/ day of other kinds of phenolics. Regarding the variables studied this present study shows that those men who live in the countryside and in the northeastern region of the country had a higher consumption of phenolic compounds. Besides, consumption was higher by adults and the elderly, the medium income classes, the population with incomplete and complete primary education and those with adequate nutrition and also overweight status.
   Conclusion
   The intake of phenolic compounds can be considered low, especially where consumption of fruit and vegetables is insufficient. We can conclude that coffee and black beans were the best contributors to phenolic intake.

AB Background: Consumption of sugar, specifically sugar-sweetened beverages, has been widely held responsible by the media for the global rise in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
   Sources of data: Systematic reviews and dietary guidelines relating dietary sugars to T2DM.
   Areas of agreement: Weight gain and T2DM incidence are associated with diet and lifestyle patterns characterized by high consumptions of any sweetened beverages. High sugar intakes impair risk factors for macrovascular complications of T2DM.
   Areas of controversy: Much of the association between sugars and T2DM is eliminated by adjusting data for body mass index (BMI). However, BMI adjustment does not fully account for adiposity (r(2)=0.65-0.75). Excess sugar can promote weight gain, thus T2DM, through extra calories, but has no unique diabetogenic effect at physiological levels.
   Growing points: Ethical concerns about caffeine added to sweetened beverages, undetectable by consumers, to increase consumption.
   Areas timely for developing research: Evidence needed for limiting dietary sugar below 10% energy intake.

AB Obesity leads to changes in miRNA expression in adipose tissue, and this modulation is linked to the pathophysiology of the disease. Green tea (GT) is a natural source of polyphenols that have been shown to confer health benefits, particularly preventing metabolic diseases. Here, we investigated if the beneficial effects of GT in obesity results from changes in the miRNA profile in white adipose tissue. GT treatment [500 mg/body weight (BW)/12 weeks] increased energy expenditure of high-fat diet-fed mice (16 weeks), leading to reduced weight gain, decreased adiposity, reduced inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity. These phenotypes were associated with a decrease in the expression of miR-335 in the adipose tissue. miR-335 was up-regulated by TNF-alpha in adipocytes and, in turn, down-regulated genes involved in insulin signaling and lipid metabolism. On the other hand, GT inhibited TNF-a effect. In conclusion, miR-335 serves as a link between inflammation and impaired metabolism in adipose tissue, providing an important mechanistic insight into the molecular basis underlying GT action during obesity.

AB Background: Caffeine is a common additive in formulated beverages, including sugar-sweetened beverages. Currently there are no data on the consumption of caffeinated formulated beverages in Australian children and adolescents. This study aimed to determine total intake and consumption patterns of CFBs in a nationally representative sample of Australian children aged 2-16 years and to determine contribution of CFBs to total caffeine intake. Consumption by day type, mealtime and location was also examined.
   Methods: Dietary data from one 24-hour recall collected in the 2007 Australian National Children's Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey were analysed. CFBs were defined as beverages to which caffeine has been added as an additive, including cola-type beverages and energy drinks. Socioeconomic status was based on the highest level of education attained by the participant's primary caregiver. Time of day of consumption was classified based on traditional mealtimes and type of day of consumption as either a school or non-school day. Location of consumption was defined by the participant during the survey.
   Results: On the day of the survey 15% (n = 642) of participants consumed CFBs. Older children and those of low socioeconomic background were more likely to consume CFBs (both P < 0.001). Amongst the 642 consumers mean (95% CI) intakes were 151 (115-187) g/day, 287 (252-321) g/day, 442 (400-484) g/day, and 555 (507-602) g/day for 2-3, 4-8, 9-13 and 14-16 year olds respectively. Consumers of CFBs had higher intakes of caffeine (mean (95% CI) 61 (55-67) mg vs. 11 (10-12) mg) and energy (mean (95% CI) 9,612 (9,247-9978) kJ vs. 8,186 (8,040-8,335) kJ) than non-consumers (both P < 0.001). CFBs contributed 69% of total daily caffeine intake. CFB intake was higher on non-school days compared with school days (P < 0.005) and consumption occurred predominantly at the place of residence (56%), within the "dinner" time bracket (17: 00-20: 30, 44%).
   Conclusions: The consumption of CFBs by all age groups within Australian children is of concern. Modifications to the permissibility of caffeine as a food additive may be an appropriate strategy to reduce the intake of caffeine in this age group. Additional areas for intervention include targeting parental influences over mealtime beverage choices.

AB Weight loss >= 5 percent is sufficient to significantly reduce health risks for obese people; therefore, development of novel weight loss compounds with reduced toxicity is urgently required. After screening of natural compounds with anti-adipogenesis properties in 3T3-L1 cells, we determined that kahweol, a coffee-specific diterpene, inhibited adipogenesis. Kahweol reduced lipid accumulation and expression levels of adipogenesis and lipid accumulation-related factors. Levels of phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated JAK2, that induce lipid accumulation, decreased in kahweol-treated cells. Particularly, kahweol treatment significantly increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. We revealed that depletion of AMPK alleviated reduction in lipid accumulation from kahweol treatment, suggesting that inhibition of lipid accumulation by kahweol is dependent on AMPK activation. We detected more rapid reduction in blood glucose levels in mice administrated kahweol than in control mice. We suggest that kahweol has anti-obesity effects and should be studied further for possible therapeutic applications.

AB The present research aimed to evaluate the use of spent coffee grounds (SCG) from instant coffee as a food ingredient and its application in bakery products. Data on physicochemical characterization, thermal stability and food safety of SCG were acquired. Evaluation of feasibility as dietary fibre was also determined. Results showed SCG are natural source of antioxidant insoluble fibre, essential amino acids, low glycaemic sugars, resistant to thermal food processing and digestion process, and totally safe. In the present work, SCG were incorporated in biscuit formulations for the first time. Low-calorie sweeteners and oligofructose were also included in the food formulations. Nutritional quality, chemical (acrylamide, hydroxymethylfurfural and advanced glycation end products) and microbiological safety and sensory tests of the biscuits were carried out. Innovative biscuits were obtained according to consumers' preferences with high nutritional and sensorial quality and potential to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.

AB Beneficial effects of green tea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae) extracts against obesity have been reported; however, the anti-obesity ability of the major components of green tea, polysaccharides, polyphenols and caffeine is not clear. Therefore, experiments with total green tea extracts, polyphenols, polysaccharides, caffeine, and a complex of polysaccharide and polyphenol at a dose of 400 or 800 mg kg(-1) were conducted on high-fat diet fed rats for 6 weeks to investigate their anti-obesity effects. The results indicated that polyphenols and polysaccharides were responsible for the suppressive effect of green tea extracts on body weight increase and fat accumulation. Moreover, polyphenols, polysaccharides, or caffeine can improve blood lipid and antioxidant levels, and effectively reduce rat serum leptin levels, inhibit the absorption of fatty acids, and markedly reduce the expression levels of the IL-6 and TNF-alpha gene. Furthermore, it was shown that polysaccharides and polyphenols were synergistic in reduction of serum leptin levels and in anti-inflammatory activity. These results suggest that the polysaccharide combination with polyphenols might be a potential therapy against obesity.

AB Cardiometabolic disease, comprising cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and their associated risk factors including metabolic syndrome and obesity, is the leading cause of death worldwide. Plant foods are rich sources of different groups of bioactive compounds, which might not be essential throughout life but promote health and well-being by reducing the risk of age-related chronic diseases. However, heterogeneity in the responsiveness to bioactive compounds can obscure associations between their intakes and health outcomes, resulting in the hiding of health benefits for specific population groups and thereby limiting our knowledge of the exact role of the different bioactive compounds for health. The heterogeneity in response suggests that some individuals may benefit more than others from the health effects of these bioactive compounds. However, to date, this interindividual variation after habitual intake of plant bioactive compounds has been little explored. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the existing research that has revealed interindividual variability in the responsiveness to plant-food bioactive compound consumption regarding cardiometabolic outcomes, focusing on polyphenols, caffeine and plant sterols, and the identified potential determinants involved.

AB AimWorldwide, there are concerns about the link between fast food and overall poor dietary quality and weight gain. Beverages and snack foods purchased from coffee chains may contribute excess energy and nutrients to the diet if they are consumed in addition to usual meals. The present study investigated the energy, saturated fat and sugar content of beverages and sweet snacks from major coffee chains and compared the nutrient content to daily intake (DI) reference values for adults.
   MethodsNutrition information per serve was sourced from the Australian websites of five coffee chains with the largest number of outlets in New South Wales and compared to DI reference values for adults for energy, saturated fat and sugars. Energy per serve was compared to 600kJ, the Australian Dietary Guidelines recommendation for one serve of a discretionary food.
   ResultsEighty-four per cent (n=238) of sweet snacks and 65% (n=79) of cold beverages provided more than two equivalent serves (1200kJ) of a discretionary food. Sixteen (13%) cold beverages and 47 (16%) sweet snacks provided over 50% DI of saturated fat. Sixty-six (54%) cold beverages and 47 (16%) sweet snacks had more than half the DI of sugars.
   ConclusionsFood and beverage items from coffee chains may contribute to excess intake of energy and other nutrients of public health concern if consumed in addition to meals. To assist consumers to make informed and healthier fast food choices, accessible detailed nutrition information should be available along with reductions in portion sizes and reformulation to more nutritious menu items.

AB Establishing and linking the proposed health benefits of dietary polyphenols to their consumption requires measurement of polyphenol intake in appropriate samples and an understanding of factors that influence their intake in the general population.
   This study examined polyphenol intake estimated from 3- and 7-day food diaries in a sample of 246 UK women aged 18-50 years. Estimation of the intake of 20 polyphenol subclasses commonly present in foods consumed by the sample studied was done using Phenol-Explorer(A (R)) and USDA polyphenol databases. Women were participants in the Leeds Women's Wellbeing Study (LWW) (n = 143), a dietary intervention study aimed at overweight women (mean age 37.2 +/- 9.4 years; mean BMI 30.8 +/- 3.1 kg/m(2)), and the Diet and Health Study (DH) (n = 103) which aimed to examine the relationship between polyphenol intake and cognitive function (mean age 25.0 +/- 9.0 years; mean BMI 24.5 +/- 4.6 kg/m(2)).
   The estimated intake of polyphenol subclasses was significantly different between the two samples (p < 0.01) with consumption of 1292 +/- 844 and 808 +/- 680 mg/day for the LWW and DH groups, respectively. Flavanols and hydroxycinnamic acids were the most important contributors to the polyphenols consumed by both groups, owing to tea and coffee consumption. Other major polyphenol food sources included fruits, vegetables and processed foods.
   Older women consumed more polyphenol-containing foods and beverages, which was due to the higher coffee and tea consumption amongst the LWW participants.

AB Background: Very few weight and fat loss supplements undergo finished-product research to examine efficacy. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an 8-week diet and exercise program on body composition, hip and waist girth, and adipokines and evaluate whether a dietary supplement containing raspberry ketone, capsaicin, caffeine, garlic, and Citrus aurantium enhanced outcomes.
   Methods: Overweight men and women completed this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Participants consumed 4 capsules/d of supplement (EXP; n = 18) or placebo (PLA; n = 18). Participants underwent 8 weeks of daily supplementation, calorie restriction (500 kcal < RMR [resting metabolic rate] x 1.2), and supervised progressive exercise training 3 times a week. Body composition, girth, and adipokines were assessed at baseline and postintervention (T1 and T2).
   Results: Significant decreases in weight (-2.6 +/- 0.57 kg, p < 0.001), fat mass (-1.8 +/- 0.20 kg; p < 0.001), and percentage body fat (-3.7% +/- 0.29%, p < 0.001) and a significant increase in lean body mass (LBM; 1.5 +/- 0.26 kg; p < 0.001) were seen from T1 to T2 in both groups. For men, only those in the EXP group increased LBM from T1 to T2 (1.3 +/- 0.38 kg; p < 0.05). Hip girth was also reduced, with the women in the EXP group (-10.7 +/- 2.15 cm, p < 0.001) having a greater reduction. There was a time by group interaction, with significant decreases in leptin (p < 0.001) and significant increases in adiponectin (p < 0.05) in the EXP group.
   Conclusions: Significant improvements in adipokines and leptin support the utility of exercise, diet, and fat loss for impacting inflammatory biomarkers. The improvement in adiponectin with EXP may suggest a unique health mechanism.

AB Objective: Dietary patterns have been pointed out as useful diet quality indicators, but evidence about their relationship to metabolic phenotypes is still scarce. Thus, the present study aimed to verify the relationship between dietary patterns and metabolic phenotypes in Brazilian adults. Design: Cross-sectional study. A food consumption frequency questionnaire assessed food consumption profiles. Metabolic phenotypes were defined based on the criteria of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: overweight or normal weight and metabolically healthy (MHOW and MHNW) or unhealthy (MUOW and MUNW). Dietary patterns were established through exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis. The associations were tested using multinomial logistic regression. Setting: Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Participants: Individuals (n 896) aged 20-59 years of both sexes, selected using probabilistic sampling. Results: Three dietary patterns were identified: Unhealthy pattern (alcoholic beverages, oils and fats, condiments, soda and juice, sugars and sweets, snacks, and meat and derivatives), Traditional pattern (culinary preparations, beans, milk and dairy products, and coffee and tea) and Healthy pattern (vegetables and fruits, whole grains, chicken and fish, and skimmed milk). Unhealthy pattern was positively associated with the MHOW and MUOW phenotypes in the fourth quartile (OR = 1 center dot 84; 95 % CI 1 center dot 06, 3 center dot 22) and in the third (OR = 1 center dot 94; 95 % CI 1 center dot 11, 3 center dot 39) and fourth (OR = 2 center dot 56; 95 % CI 1 center dot 41, 4 center dot 64) quartiles of consumption, respectively. Healthy pattern was also associated with these phenotypes. Conclusions: Both the pattern comprising energy-dense foods and the healthier pattern were associated with overweight phenotypes among Brazilian adults.

AB Aronia fruits (chokeberry: Aronia melanocarpa E.) containing phenolic phytochemicals, such as cyanidin 3-glycosides and chlorogenic acid, have attracted considerable attention because of their potential human health benefits in humans including antioxidant activities and ability to improved vision. In the present study, the effects of anthocyanin-rich phytochemicals from aronia fruits (aronia phytochemicals) on visceral fat accumulation and fasting hyperglycemia were examined in rats fed a high-fat diet (Experiment 1). Total visceral fat mass was significantly lower in rats fed aronia phytochemicals than that in both the control group and bilberry phytochemicals-supplemented rats (p < 0.05). Moreover, perirenal and epididymal adipose tissue mass in rats fed aronia phytochemicals was significantly lower than that in both the control and bilberry phytochemicals group. Additionally, the mesenteric adipose tissue mass in aronia phytochemicals-fed rats was significantly low (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the fasting blood glucose levels significantly decreased in rats fed aronia phytochemicals for 4 weeks compared to that in the control rats (p <0.05). Therefore, we investigated the effects of phytochemicals on postprandial hyperlipidemia after corn oil loading in rats, pancreatic lipase activity in vitro, and the plasma glycemic response after sucrose loading in order to elucidate the preventive factor of aronia phytochemical on visceral fat accumulation. In the oral corn oil tolerance tests (Experiment 2), aronia phytochemicals significantly inhibited the increases in plasma triglyceride levels, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.50 mg/mL. However, the inhibitory activity was similar to that of bilberry and tea catechins. In the sucrose tolerance tests (Experiment 3), aronia phytochemicals also significantly inhibited the increases in blood glucose levels that were observed in the control animals (p < 0.05). These results suggest that anthocyanin-rich phytochemicals in aronia fruits suppress visceral fat accumulation and hyperglycemia by inhibiting pancreatic lipase activity and/or intestinal lipid absorption.

AB Sugar sweetened beverages (SSB), artificially sweetened beverages (ASB), juice, coffee and tea has been associated with risk of metabolic disease. High consumption of these beverages may be associated with certain characteristics of the overall diet that would be important to take into account when analysing beverage-disease associations. Here, we investigate five beverages and their association with lifestyle and diet in 25,112 individuals from the Malmo Diet and Cancer Cohort. We observed that high consumption of SSB was associated with lower intakes of foods perceived as healthy. However, high consumption of both tea and juice was associated with higher intakes of foods perceived as healthy. Further, high consumption of ASB was associated with higher intakes of low-fat products. High consumption of coffee was associated with higher intakes of meat and high-fat margarine, and lower intake of breakfast cereals. We observe five beverages to associate with different lifestyle and dietary patterns.

AB Introduction: Energy drinks refer to non-alcoholic beverages that contain caffeine, amino acids, herbs, and vitamins. Although energy drinks are marketed to reduce fatigue and improve physical/mental performance, frequent consumption of these beverages has been linked to negative health consequences. The purpose of this study is to provide timely, national estimates of the percentage of energy drink consumers in the U.S. and to analyze trends in energy drink intake between 2003 and 2016.
   Methods: A total of 9,911 adolescents (aged 12-19 years); 12,103 young adults (aged 20-39 years); and 11,245 middle-aged adults (aged 40-59 years) were assessed using dietary data from the 2003-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. For each age group (adolescents, young adults, and middle-aged adults), logistic regression was used to estimate the proportion of energy drink consumers, and negative binomial regression was used to estimate per capita energy drink consumption, adjusting for covariates. Differences in total caffeine intake between energy drink consumers and non-consumers were examined by pooling all survey years together and using negative binomial regression. Analyses were conducted in 2018.
   Results: From 2003 to 2016, the prevalence of energy drink consumption increased significantly for adolescents (0.2% to 1.4%, p=0.028); young adults (0.5% to 5.5%, p<0.001); and middle-aged adults (0.0% to 1.2%, p=0.006). Per capita consumption of energy drinks increased significantly from 2003 to 2016 only for young adults (1.1 to 9.7 calories, p<0.001). Pooled across years, energy drink consumers had significantly higher total caffeine intake compared with non-consumers for adolescents (227.0 mg vs 52.1 mg, p<0.001); young adults (278.7 mg vs 135.3 mg, p<0.001); and middle-aged adults (348.8 mg vs 219.0 mg, p<0.001).
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that consumption of energy drinks has grown substantially and that these drinks are a major source of caffeine among those who consume them. (C) 2019 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Beverage consumption is a modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D), but there is insufficient evidence to inform the suitability of substituting 1 type of beverage for another.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of T2D when consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) was replaced with consumption of fruit juice, milk, coffee, or tea.
   Methods: In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct case-cohort study of 8 European countries (n = 27,662, with 12,333 cases of incident T2D, 1992-2007), beverage consumption was estimated at baseline by dietary questionnaires. Using Prentice-weighted Cox regression adjusting for other beverages and potential confounders, we estimated associations of substituting 1 type of beverage for another on incident T2D.
   Results: Mean +/- SD of estimated consumption of SSB was 55 +/- 105 g/d. Means +/- SDs for the other beverages were as follows: fruit juice, 59 +/- 101 g/d; milk, 209 +/- 203 g/d; coffee, 381 +/- 372 g/d; and tea, 152 +/- 282 g/d. Substituting coffee for SSBs by 250 g/d was associated with a 21% lower incidence of T2D (95% CI: 12%, 29%). The rate difference was -12.0 (95% CI: -20.0, -5.0) per 10,000 person-years among adults consuming SSBs >= 250 g/d (absolute rate = 48.3/10,000). Substituting tea for SSBs was estimated to lower T2D incidence by 22% (95% CI: 15%, 28%) or -11.0 (95% CI:-20.0, -2.6) per 10,000 person-years, whereas substituting fruit juice or milk was estimated not to alter T2D risk significantly.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate a potential benefit of substituting coffee or tea for SSBs for the primary prevention of T2D and may help formulate public health recommendations on beverage consumption in different populations.

AB Background: Green tea consumption has been associated with favorable changes in body weight and obesity-related hormones, although it is not known whether these changes result from green tea polyphenols or caffeine.
   Objective: We examined the impact of decaffeinated green tea extract (GTE) containing 843 mg of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate on anthropometric variables, obesity-associated hormones, and glucose homeostasis.
   Methods: The Minnesota Green Tea Trial was a 12-mo randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 937 healthy postmenopausal women assigned to either decaffeinated GTE (1315 mg total catechins/d) or a placebo, stratified by catechol-O-amethyltransferase (COM7) genotype. This study was conducted in a subset of 237 overweight and obese participants [body mass index (BMI) >= 25 kg/m(2)].
   Results: No changes in energy intake, body weight, BMI, or waist circumference (WC) were observed over 12 mo in women taking GTE In = 117) or placebo In = 120). No differences were seen in circulating leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, or glucose concentrations at month 12. Participants randomly assigned to GTE with baseline insulin >= 10 mu U/mL (n= 23) had a decrease in fasting serum insulin from baseline to month 12 (-1.43 +/- 0.59 plU/mL), whereas those randomly assigned to placebo with baseline insulin >= 10 mu IU/mL In = 19) had an increase in insulin over 12 mo (0.55 +/- 0.641.1 mu IU/mL, P< 0.01). Participants with the homozygous high-activity (G/G) form of COMT had significantly lower adiponectin (5.97 +/- 0.50 compared with 7.58 +/- 0.53 mu g/mL, P = 0.03) and greater insulin concentrations (7.63 +/- 0.53 compared with 6.18 +/- 0.36 mu lU/mL, P = 0.02) at month 12 compared with those with the low-activity (NA) genotype, regardless of treatment group.
   Conclusions: Decaffeinated GTE was not associated with reductions in body weight, BMI, or WC and did not alter energy intake or mean hormone concentrations in healthy postmenopausal women over 12 mo. GTE decreased fasting insulin concentrations in those with elevated baseline fasting concentrations. The high-activity form of the COMT enzyme may be associated with elevations in insulin and a reduction in adiponectin concentrations over time. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00917735.

AB High consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) among adolescents has turned into a global concern due to its negative impact on health. This cross-sectional study determined the amount of SSB consumption among adolescents and its associated factors. A total of 421 adolescents aged 13.3 +/- 1.3 years (41.8% males, 58.2% females) completed a self-administered questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, physical activity, screen-viewing behavior, sleep quality, frequency of eating at fast food restaurants, home food availability, peer social pressure, parenting practice, and SSB consumption. Weight and height were measured. Results showed that the mean daily consumption of SSBs among adolescents was 1038.15 +/- 725.55 mL. The most commonly consumed SSB was malted drink, while the least commonly consumed SSB was instant coffee. The multiple linear regression results revealed that younger age (beta = -0.204, p < 0.001), higher physical activity (beta = 0.125, p = 0.022), higher screen time (beta = 0.147, p = 0.007), poorer sleep quality (beta = 0.228, p < 0.001), and unhealthy home food availability (beta = 0.118, p = 0.032) were associated with a higher SSB intake. Therefore, promoting a healthy lifestyle may help to reduce the excessive consumption of SSBs among adolescents.

AB Blueberry leaf is currently a popular dietary supplement. Effects of dietary blueberry leaf and its active components on body fat accumulation were examined. C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat, high-sucrose diet with or without 3% blueberry leaf extract (BLEx) or 3% concentrated-polyphenolic BLEx (CP BLEx) for 8 weeks. Compared to mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet without blueberry leaf, BLEx and CP BLEx significantly reduced body weight and adipose tissue weight gain. Adipocytes were also smaller and and liver lipid accumulatioin was significantly inhibited in mice fed either BLEx or CP BLEx. These effects tended to be more pronounced in mice fed CP BLEx compared to in mice fed BLEx. Together, results suggest that blueberry leaf inhibits body fat accumulation typically observed in mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet, and that inhibition is attributable to polyphenolic components in leaf extracts.

AB The aims of this study were to identify cross-sectional dietary patterns (DPs) in a representative sample of 7-10-year-old schoolchildren, to examine how scores for these DPs tracked over a time period of five years (from age 7-10 years to 12-15 years), and to investigate longitudinal associations between changes in DPs scores and changes in BMI (Body Mass Index) z-scores. Children aged 7-10-years were examined in 2007 (n = 1158) and a subset of the sample participated in a follow-up in 2012 (n = 458). Factor analysis (FA) was applied to derive DPs at baseline. The change in DP from childhood to adolescence was analyzed by comparing factor scores using the complete cases, in which factor loadings were the ones evaluated at baseline. Associations of BMI change with DP change were assessed by multivariate linear regression. At baseline, four DP were identified that explained 47.9% of the food intake variance. On average, the factor scores of DP II (salty snacks, French fries, fast-food, sugary beverages) decreased in follow-up, while no changes were observed for DP I (rice, cooked beans, beef/poultry, leafy vegetables), DP III (fruits, cooked and leafy vegetables, fruit juices, pasta, milk, cheese), and DP IV (milk, coffee with milk, cheese, breads/biscuits). No significant linear association was shown between changes in BMI z-scores and changes in DP scores from childhood to adolescence. In conclusion, three out of four DP scores identified at baseline tracked slightly in adolescence.

AB Background/objectives We aimed to study the associations of dietary patterns (DPs) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) among Ghanaian adults.
   Subjects/methods In the multi-centre, cross-sectional RODAM (Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants) study (n = 4543), three overall DPs ("mixed", "rice, pasta, meat and fish," and "roots, tubers and plantain") and two site-specific DPs per study site (rural Ghana, urban Ghana and Europe) were identified by principal component analysis. The DPs-T2D associations were calculated by logistic regression models.
   Results Higher adherence to the "rice, pasta, meat and fish" DP (characterized by legumes, rice/pasta, meat, fish, cakes/sweets, condiments) was associated with decreased odds of T2D, adjusted for socio-demographic factors, total energy intake and adiposity measures (odds ratio (OR) per 1 SD = 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.70-0.92). Similar DPs and T2D associations were discernible in urban Ghana and Europe. In the total study population, neither the "mixed" DP (whole grain cereals, sweet spreads, dairy products, potatoes, vegetables, poultry, coffee/tea, sodas/juices, olive oil) nor the "roots, tubers and plantain" DP (refined cereals, fruits, nuts/seeds, roots/tubers/plantain, fermented maize products, legumes, palm oil, condiments) was associated with T2D. Yet, after the exclusion of individuals with self-reported T2D, the "roots, tubers and plantain" DP was inversely associated with T2D (ORper 1 SD = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69-1.12).
   Conclusion In this Ghanaian population, DPs characterized by the intake of legumes, fish, meat and confectionery were inversely associated with T2D. The effect of a traditional-oriented diet (typical staples, vegetables and legumes) remains unclear.

AB PurposeTo assess the association between dietary intake patterns from 1 to 4years and BMI and body shape at age of 6years.MethodsThis longitudinalstudy was based on3374 Brazilian children from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study. We used previously described dietary patterns from 1 to 4years as the main exposure. We defined body shape using scores for corpulence (a recently described body shape component measured by Photonic Scanner), and trunk and gynoid fat mass percentage from DXA. We run linear regression models to evaluate the associations between dietary patterns from 1 to 4years and BMI and body shape at 6years.ResultsSeveral apparent associations between dietary patterns and BMI or body shape were explained by sociodemographic factors. High adherence to snacks (positive loadings to coffee, bread and cookies) at 4years predicted lower BMI, but higher gynoid fat mass percentage at 6 years, while higher adherence to staple at 2years (positive loadings to rice and beans) predicted higher trunk fat mass and lower gynoid fat mass. Finally, higher scores on milks at 1year (positive loading to breast milk) predicted higher gynoid fat mass at 6years.ConclusionThere were inconsistent associations between dietary patterns in infancy and early childhood and BMI and body shape at 6years. In adjusted analyses, higher adherence to breast milk at 1year and to snacks at 4years appeared to be beneficial for body shape, associated with lower BMI, but higher peripheral fat.

AB Purpose To investigate associations between dietary patterns, socio-demographic factors and anthropometric measurements in adult New Zealanders.
   Methods Dietary patterns were identified using factor analysis in adults 15 years plus (n = 4657) using 24-h diet recall data from the 2008/09 New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey. Multivariate regression was used to investigate associations between dietary patterns and age, gender and ethnicity. After controlling for demographic factors, associations between dietary patterns and food insecurity, deprivation, education, and smoking were investigated. Associations between dietary patterns and body mass index and waist circumference were examined adjusting for demographic factors, smoking and energy intake.
   Results Two dietary patterns were identified. 'Healthy' was characterised by breakfast cereal, low fat milk, soy and rice milk, soup and stock, yoghurt, bananas, apples, other fruit and tea, and low intakes of pies and pastries, potato chips, white bread, takeaway foods, soft drinks, beer and wine. 'Traditional' was characterised by beef, starchy vegetables, green vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, savoury sauces, regular milk, cream, sugar, tea and coffee, and was low in takeaway foods. The 'healthy' pattern was positively associated with age, female gender, New Zealand European or other ethnicity, and a secondary school qualification, and inversely associated with smoking, food insecurity, area deprivation, BMI and waist circumference. The 'traditional' pattern was positively associated with age, male gender, smoking, food insecurity and inversely associated with a secondary school qualification.
   Conclusions A 'Healthy' dietary pattern was associated with higher socio-economic status and reduced adiposity, while the 'traditional' pattern was associated with lower socio-economic status.

AB Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives are important class of polyphenolic compounds originated from the Mavolanate-Shikimate biosynthesis pathways in plants. Several simple phenolic compounds such as cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, chlorgenic acid, and rosmarinic acid belong to this class. These phenolic compounds possess potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds were also showed potential therapeutic benefit in experimental diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Recent evidences also suggest that they may serve as valuable molecule for the treatment of obesity related health complications. In adipose tissues, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives inhibit macrophage infiltration and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation in obese animals. Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives also reduce the expression of the potent proinflammatory adipokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), and they increase the secretion of an anti-inflammatory agent adiponectin from adipocytes. Furthermore, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives also prevent adipocyte differentiation and lower lipid profile in experimental animals. Through these diverse mechanisms hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives reduce obesity and curtail associated adverse health complications.

AB Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is now the leading cause of death globally and is a growing health concern. Lifestyle factors, including nutrition, play an important role in the etiology and treatment of CVD. Functional foods based on their basic nutritional functions can decrease the risk of many chronic diseases and have some physiological benefits. They contain physiologically active components either from plant or animal sources, marketed with the claim of their ability to reduce heart disease risk, focusing primarily on established risk factors, which are hyperlipidemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity/overweight, elevated lipoprotein A level, small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and elevated inflammatory marker levels. Functional foods are suspected to exert their cardioprotective effects mainly through blood lipid profile level and improve hypertension control, endothelial function, platelet aggregation, and antioxidant actions. Clinical and epidemiological observations indicate that vegetable and fruit fiber, nuts and seeds, sea foods, coffee, tea, and dark chocolate have cardioprotective potential in humans, as well whole-grain products containing intact grain kernels rich in fiber and trace nutrients. They are nutritionally more important because they contain phytoprotective substances that might work synergistically to reduce cardiovascular risk. This review will focus on the reciprocal interaction between functional foods and the potential link to cardiovascular health and the possible mechanisms of action.

AB Background Although several studies have examined the link between specific working conditions and health behaviours, very few have comparatively assessed the health behaviours of different occupational groups.
   Aims To compare protective and risky health behaviours among police officers, ambulance workers, hospital staff (doctors and nurses) and office workers, prompted by the need to identify key areas for interventions tailored to the needs of different occupational groups.
   Methods A cross-sectional postal survey using the Health Behaviours Inventory, assessing health behaviours which are risky (alcohol intake, smoking, coffee consumption, fast food meals and painkiller consumption) and protective (physical activity, eating breakfast and hours of sleep).
   Results The sample consisted of 1451 employees. Ambulance workers smoked the most cigarettes per day (F-(4,F-1405) = 8.63, P < 0.01), while doctors consumed twice as many fast food meals as any other occupational group (F-(4,F-1415) = 78.45, P < 0.01) and had the highest daily caffeine consumption (F-(4,F-1440) = 11.17, P < 0.01). Ambulance workers and doctors reported the highest frequency of alcohol consumption per week (F-(4,F-1421) = 10.13, P < 0.01). In regard to protective health behaviours, office workers reported the highest number of breakfast meals per week (F-(4,F-1431) = 5.7, P < 0.01) and sleeping hours per night (F-(4,F-1438) = 170.34, P < 0.01), while police officers and ambulance workers exercised more frequently (F-(4,F-1420) = 5.764, P < 0.01).
   Conclusions The results of the study highlight key priorities for health promotion for different occupational groups which need to be taken into consideration in policy making and developing workplace interventions.

AB Obesity, considered as a consequence of overnutrition, sustains a low-degree inflammatory state and results in insulin-resistance and type 2 diabetes. Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of 5-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA) in high-fat diet-induced obese rats. Serum interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) levels were determined. Expression of genes related to TG metabolism, macrophage biomarkers, and inflammation was assessed by real-time PCR. Protein expression of NF-kappa B, PPAR gamma 2, and phosphorylated I kappa B alpha was evaluated by western blotting, and the histology of adipose tissue was examined. Supplementation of the rat diet with 5-CQA reduced obesity development, macrophage infiltration, and steatosis. Additionally, 5-CQA decreased the expression of NF-kappa B and downstream inflammatory cytokines, but increased the expression of PPAR gamma 2, in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, 5-CQA improved obesity and obesity-related metabolic disturbances via PPAR gamma 2 and the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB Purpose of ReviewThis paper reviews the genetic and non-genetic factors that provided predictions of, or were associated with, weight loss and other metabolic changes in the POUNDS Lost clinical trial of weight loss. This trial randomized 811 individuals who were overweight or obese to one of four diets that contained either 15% or 25% protein and 20% or 40% fat in a 2x2 factorial design. A standard behavioral weight loss program was available for all participants who were followed for 2years with an 80% completion rate.Recent FindingsNineteen genes and five genetic risk scores were used along with demographic, behavioral, endocrine, and metabolic measurements. Genetic variations in most of the genes were associated with weight loss, but this association often varied with the dietary assignment. A number of demographic and behavioral factors, including attendance at behavioral sessions and food cravings were predictive of weight changes. A high baseline level of free triiodothyronine or free thyroxine predicted the magnitude of weight loss. Several perfluoroakyl compounds predicted more rapid weight regain.SummaryGenetic evidence from POUNDS Lost provides guidance toward selection of a personalized weight loss diet and improvement in metabolic profile. There is still room for additional research into the predictors of weight loss.

AB Background and Objective: Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) are the most abundant residual material (45%) obtained during the instant coffee production. Therefore, around 6 million tons of SCGs generated per year. The purposes of the present study consisted in evaluating the use of SCGs as innovative functional food ingredient in bakery products and study the effect of SCGs and their chemical constituents on the sensory properties, volatile constituents and rheological properties of the final product. Materials and Methods: Effect of mixing wheat flour with 2, 4 and 6% SCGs on rheological properties of the obtained dough was evaluated, then chemical, texture profile and sensory properties of the final product were studied. Results: Rheological properties of mixed wheat flour with SCGs dough was affected slightly with the higher dietary fiber content. Moisture content of SCGs reached to 58.98%, therefore, was dried to reach 7.47% to control the microbial activity. Protein, ash, crude fiber and total carbohydrate of SCGs were 8.97, 2.77, 51.86 and 78.5%, respectively. Also, SCGs is good source of lipids (13.89%). Chemical composition of biscuit indicated that increasing mixing level of SCGs (2-6%) has shown good enhancement in fiber and ashes compared to control sample. Volatile sensory active compounds of biscuits and its supplemented mix with SCGs was evaluated. Thirty-eight volatile compounds was separated and identified in the biscuit samples by using SPME/GC-MS analysis. Hunter color parameter of produced biscuit indicated that whiteness (L*) of control sample reached to 71.17, while mixing SCGs with wheat flour at levels 2, 4 and 6% decreased L* to 66.31, 54.88 and 43.88, respectively. Also, redness degree (a*) was lower in wheat flour (0.45) than SCGs (3.57). Therefore, a* value of biscuit increased with increasing mixing level of SCGs. Sensory properties of biscuits showed that increasing SCGs level decreased significantly the color score but overall acceptability not affected significantly. Conclusion: Spent coffee grounds contains sufficient amounts from dietary insoluble fibers, protein, lipids, ashes and lower glycaemic sugars. Mixing wheat flour with SCGs affected slightly the rheological properties of dough and overall acceptability of the final product. Therefore, the obtained biscuit could be recommended to patients with obesity-related diseases and diabetes in addition to people looking for foods intake with reduced energy.

AB Phlorizin is a natural polyphenol with many bioactivities, however, its low water solubility limits its application. Phlorizin oxidation product 2 (POP2) has higher water solubility than phlorizin. However, reaction velocity and conversion rate of POP2 are low, and its bioactivity has not been elucidated. Thus, we have established a new method for preparation of POP2 with a purity of 96.8%, and the inhibitory activity of POP2 on 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes was investigated. POP2 decreased adipocyte viability and inhibited the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides (TG). Furthermore, POP2 suppressed transcription of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4), led to reduce lipid accumulation. Also, POP2 down-regulated transcription and expression of PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha, and FAS, led to inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. An efficient method to produce POP2 was developed, and we demonstrated that POP2 reduced lipid accretion. These results are useful for potential applications of phlorizin in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

AB In this study, the anti-adipogenetic activity of 300 plant extracts was investigated using an Oil Red O staining assay in a 3T3-L1 cell line. Our results indicate that three plants, including the stem and leaf of Physalis angulata, the whole grass of Solidago virgaurea, and the root of Dioscorea nipponica, produced over 90% inhibition of adipogenesis. Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, which demonstrated a 48.2% inhibitory effect on adipogenesis without cytotoxicity, was isolated from the butanol layer of a water extract of S. virgaurea guided by the anti-adipogenesis assay in 3T3-L1. PPAR- and C/EBP expression levels were determined using western blot, and our results indicate that kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside has a strong anti-adipogenic effect in 3T3-L1 cells through the suppression of increases in PPAR- and C/EBP expression.

AB ObjectivesAster spathulifolius Maxim (AS), known for its anti-viral and anti-allergic activity, is also known to reduce body weight gain in high fat diet-induced obese rats. But its molecular mechanism of the anti-obesity effects is still unclear. So, we investigated the inhibitory effect of AS extract (ASE) on adipogenesis and lipid accumulation to determine the underlying cellular molecular mechanism.
   MethodsTo perform this study, the contents of intracellular triglyceride were analysed. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were carried out to investigate the expression of adipogenic transcriptional factors.
   Key findingsASE showed the suppression of adipogenic differentiation and the considerable reduction of the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Especially, ASE inhibited the early stage of differentiation via the downregulation of C/EBP- and C/EBP-, which are early adipogenic factors. Major adipogenic factors, such as PPAR- and C/EBP-, were also subsequently inhibited. These findings were supported by Oil Red O staining and intracellular triglyceride levels. A molecular mechanism liking the effect of ASE was identified through the activation of AMPK pathway. ASE increased protein levels of phosphorylated AMPK and phosphorylated ACC.
   ConclusionsASE showed anti-adipogenic and anti-lipogenic effects through the regulation of adipogenic factors and AMPK pathway.

AB Mulberry (Moms sp.) fruits provide high levels of anthocyanins, quercetin glycoside, and chlorogenic acid. Recently, mulberry's polyphenols and their functionalities are spotlighted in different ex vivo and in vivo studies. Meanwhile, the deficiency of systematic knowledge on the health effects and polyphenols composition greatly hinders the development of mulberry as a sustainable fruit. This review briefly summarises the polyphenol compositions, metabolism, health benefits, and their stability in different mulberry production steps. These claimed health effects include anti-oxidative, anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, anti-obesity, and other related effects. However, although the current evidence is promising, further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the role of mulberries' polyphenols to support human health. Besides, the mechanisms by which they confer the health benefits, the bioavailability studies on mulberry's polyphenols are also scarce. We compile the research findings from the available literatures within the last two decades, and we also suggest some future perspectives in this review.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the cross-sectional associations among sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption, its substitution with beverage alternatives, and obesity outcomes in an Australian population.
   Methods: We used data from 9341 adults ages >= 19 y from the 2011-2012 Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey. Multivariate linear regression with adjustment for covariates was used to examine the associations between SSB consumption and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). Substitution modeling was used to simulate the effect of replacing SSB with water, coffee/tea, fruit juice, and milk.
   Results: SSB intake (100 g/d) was associated with higher BMI (beta = 0.06 kg/m(2); P = 0.001) and WC (beta = 0.19 cm; P < 0.001). A linear trend with BMI and WC also was seen when SSB intake was examined as categories of servings per day (P-trend <= 0.001). Replacing SSB with water, coffee/tea, or milk was inversely associated with BMI (beta= -0.07 to -0.09 kg/m(2); P < 0.001) and WC (beta= -0.25 to -0.28 cm; P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The results of the present study suggested that SSB intake is associated with obesity and that coffee/tea, water, and milk may be good alternatives for SSB. Further longitudinal and intervention studies are warranted to examine the effects of beverage substitution on obesity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) are an important global crop that can be transformed into many products impacting several health dimensions ranging from undernutrition, food security and disease prevention to issues of overnutrition including obesity, diabetes, heart disease. Processed potato products are typically categorized as high fat and sodium foods, as well as being classified as a significant source of carbohydrate, in the form of starch. Conversely, potato products are less known for their contribution of key micronutrients (vitamin C, potassium, magnesium), fiber, and phytochemicals (phenolics and carotenoids). More recent insight into the nutritional value of potatoes and the potential of potato phytochemicals to modulate oxidative and inflammatory stress as well as the potential to alter glycemic response has resulted in increased interest in strategies to improve and leverage the nutritional quality of processed potatoes. This review summarizes critical information on nutritional profiles of potatoes and their processed products and describes the state of the science relative to the influence of in-home and common commercial processing on nutritional quality and potential impacts on human health.

AB Objective
   To evaluate the association between food consumption patterns and obesity in preschool children in Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil.
   Methods
   Cross-sectional, population-based nested within a live-birth cohort study of 813 children, which has started in 2004 in Feira de Santana, Bahia. The anthropometric status among children under four years of age was evaluated based on their body mass index; obesity/severe obesity was defined as a Z-score >+2. The Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to identify dietary patterns using principal components analysis. The association between obesity and food consumption patterns was assessed using Pearson's Chi-squared test and logistic regression, adopting p<0.05 to denote statistical significance.
   Results
   Obesity was detected in 12.7% of the children investigated. Four food consumption patterns were identified: dietary pattern 1 (milk and other dairy products, vegetables and tubers, cereals, legumes, fruits, and fish); dietary pattern 2 (deep-fried or baked snacks, soft drinks/artificial fruit juices, oils and fats, sweets, and coffee/tea); dietary pattern 3 (encased meats, fast food, ketchup/mayonnaise, and eggs); and, dietary pattern 4 (chicken and red meats). Obesity was statistically associated with high adherence to the dietary pattern 3 (OR=1.92; 95% CI=1.01-3.66).
   Conclusion
   The results obtained showed that the high intake of energy-dense foods (dietary pattern 3) was a contributing factor to childhood obesity. These data reinforce the need for public policies and food education programs in health units and schools, aiming to change children's eating habits, significant predictors of nutritional problems.

   Combinations of multiple fatty acids may influence cardiometabolic risk more than single fatty acids. The association of a combination of fatty acids with incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) has not been evaluated.
   Methods and findings
   We measured plasma phospholipid fatty acids by gas chromatography in 27,296 adults, including 12,132 incident cases of T2D, over the follow-up period between baseline (1991-1998) and 31 December 2007 in 8 European countries in EPIC-InterAct, a nested casecohort study. The first principal component derived by principal component analysis of 27 individual fatty acids (mole percentage) was the main exposure (subsequently called the fatty acid pattern score [FA-pattern score]). The FA-pattern score was partly characterised by high concentrations of linoleic acid, stearic acid, odd-chain fatty acids, and very-long-chain saturated fatty acids and low concentrations of.-linolenic acid, palmitic acid, and long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids, and it explained 16.1% of the overall variability of the 27 fatty acids. Based on country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox regression and random-effects meta-analysis, the FA-pattern score was associated with lower incident T2D. Comparing the top to the bottom fifth of the score, the hazard ratio of incident T2D was 0.23 (95% CI 0.19-0.29) adjusted for potential confounders and 0.37 (95% CI 0.27-0.50) further adjusted for metabolic risk factors. The association changed little after adjustment for individual fatty acids or fatty acid subclasses. In cross-sectional analyses relating the FA-pattern score to metabolic, genetic, and dietary factors, the FA-pattern score was inversely associated with adiposity, triglycerides, liver enzymes, C-reactive protein, a genetic score representing insulin resistance, and dietary intakes of soft drinks and alcohol and was positively associated with high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and intakes of polyunsaturated fat, dietary fibre, and coffee (p < 0.05 each). Limitations include potential measurement error in the fatty acids and other model covariates and possible residual confounding.
   Conclusions
   A combination of individual fatty acids, characterised by high concentrations of linoleic acid, odd-chain fatty acids, and very long-chain fatty acids, was associated with lower incidence of T2D. The specific fatty acid pattern may be influenced by metabolic, genetic, and dietary factors.

TI Dietary flavonoid intake and weight maintenance: three prospective

SO BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL

DT Article

   SUPPLEMENTATION; CONSUMPTION; OVERWEIGHT; CAFFEINE; GAIN
AB OBJECTIVE
   To examine whether dietary intake of specific flavonoid subclasses (including flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins, and flavonoid polymers) is associated with weight change over time.
   DESIGN
   Three prospective cohort studies.
   SETTING
   Health professionals in the United States.
   PARTICIPANTS
   124 086 men and women participating in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), Nurses' Health Study (NHS), and Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II).
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
   Self reported change in weight over multiple four year time intervals between 1986 and 2011.
   RESULTS
   Increased consumption of most flavonoid subclasses, including flavonols, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins, and flavonoid polymers, was inversely associated with weight change over four year time intervals, after adjustment for simultaneous changes in other lifestyle factors including other aspects of diet, smoking status, and physical activity. In the pooled results, the greatest magnitude of association was observed for anthocyanins (-0.23 (95% confidence interval -0.30 to -0.15) lbs per additional standard deviation/day, 10 mg), flavonoid polymers (-0.18 (-0.28 to -0.08) lbs per additional SD/day, 138 mg), and flavonols (-0.16 (-0.26 to -0.06) lbs per additional SD/day, 7 mg). After additional adjustment for fiber intake, associations remained significant for anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and total flavonoid polymers but were attenuated and no longer statistically significant for other subclasses.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Higher intake of foods rich in flavonols, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins, and flavonoid polymers may contribute to weight maintenance in adulthood and may help to refine dietary recommendations for the prevention of obesity and its potential consequences.

AB Functional ingredients in blueberry have the best health benefits. To obtain a better understanding of the health role of blueberry in chronic disease, we conducted systematic preventive strategies for functional ingredients in blueberry, based on comprehensive databases, especially PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and CNKI for the period 2008-2018. Blueberry is rich in flavonoids (mainly anthocyanidins), polyphenols (procyanidin), phenolic acids, pyruvic acid, chlorogenic acid, and others, which have anticancer, anti-obesity, prevent degenerative diseases, anti-inflammation, protective properties for vision and liver, prevent heart diseases, antidiabetes, improve brain function, protective lung properties, strong bones, enhance immunity, prevent cardiovascular diseases, and improve cognitive decline. The anthocyanins and polyphenols in blueberry are major functional ingredients for preventive chronic disease. These results support findings that blueberry may be one of the best functional fruits, and further reveals the mechanisms of anthocyanins and polyphenols in the health role of blueberry for chronic disease. This paper may be used as scientific evidence for developing functional foods, nutraceuticals, and novel drugs of blueberry for preventive chronic diseases.

AB Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as the co-occurrence of metabolic risk factors that includes insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and visceral obesity. The clinical significance of MetS consists of identifying a subgroup of patients sharing a common physiopathological state predisposing to chronic diseases. Clinical and scientific studies pinpoint lifestyle modification as an effective strategy aiming to reduce several features accountable for the risk of MetS onset. Among the healthy dietary patterns, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) emerges in terms of beneficial properties associated with longevity. Current evidence highlights the protective effect exerted by MedDiet on the different components of MetS. Interestingly, the effect exerted by polyphenols contained within the representative MedDiet components (i.e., olive oil, red wine, and nuts) seems to be accountable for the beneficial properties associated to this dietary pattern. In this review, we aim to summarize the principal evidence regarding the effectiveness of MedDiet-polyphenols in preventing or delaying the physiopathological components accountable for MetS onset. These findings may provide useful insights concerning the health properties of MedDiet-polyphenols as well as the novel targets destined to a tailored approach to MetS.

AB Objectives: Soda consumption is on the rise among children and adolescents. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that increased soda consumption predicts risk-taking behavior among high school students. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we used data from the 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System to compare the odds of engaging in a series of risk-taking behaviors among students who reported no soda consumption, occasional soda consumption (1 - 6 times per week), and daily soda consumption (>= 7 times per week). Results: Daily soda consumption was associated with increased odds of engaging in 90% of the risk behaviors analyzed. In addition, there were sex differences in the magnitude of the relationships for many of these behaviors. Conclusions: These data suggest that in addition to increased risk of obesity, dental caries, and reduced sleep quality, soda consumption is associated with increased risk-taking behavior.

AB Scope: Green tea (GT) consumption helps to prevent and control obesity by stimulating hepatic lipid metabolism. However, GT-induced changes in serum and liver metabolomes associated with the anti-obesity effects are not clearly understood. The aim of this study was to identify and validate metabolomic profiles in the livers and sera of GT-fed obese mice to elucidate the relationship between GT consumption and obesity prevention.
   Methods and results: Serum and liver metabolites were analyzed in mice fed normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), HFD with GT, and HFD with crude catechins, using LC-quadrupole TOF MS. The addition of 1% GT to HFD reduced adipose tissue and the levels of blood triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and leptin elevated in HFD-fed mice. We proposed an HFD-induced obesity pathway and validated it by investigating the key regulatory enzymes of mitochondrial beta-oxidation: carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and -2, acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, and acetylcoenzyme A acyltransferase. The results showed that HFD-induced abnormal mitochondrial beta-oxidation was moderated by the consumption of caffeine-and theanine-enriched GT.
   Conclusion: Results of LC/MS-based metabolomic analysis of obese mice showed changes associated with abnormal lipid and energy metabolism, which were alleviated by GT intake, indicating the mechanism underlying the anti-obesity effects of GT.

AB Procyanidins, the main ingredient of apple polyphenols, are known to possess antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects associated closely with the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We investigated the effects of orally administered apple procyanidins (APCs) on glucose metabolism using diabetic ob/ob mice. We found no difference in body weight or body composition between mice treated with APCs and untreated mice. A 4 week oral administration of APCs containing water [0.5% (w/v)] ameliorated glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and hepatic gluconeogenesis in ob/ob mice. APCs also suppressed the increase in the level of the pancreatic beta-cell. Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was significantly enhanced; pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels were significantly decreased, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation was downregulated in the liver of those mice treated with APCs. In conclusion, APCs ameliorate insulin resistance by improving hepatic insulin signaling through suppression Of hepatic inflammation in ob/ob mice, which may be a mechanism with possible beneficial health effects of APCs in disturbed glucose metabolism.

AB Caffeoylquinic acid and its isomers inhibited porcine Pancreatic Lipase (PL) activity according to a competitive mode where binding and interaction with the catalytic triad of Ser153, His264 and Asp177 simultaneously occurred. The IC50 values under which 3-caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) and its isomers 4-, 5-CQA, 3,4-, 3,5- and 4,5-diCQA inhibited half of the porcine PL activity were 1.10, 1.23, 1.24, 0.252, 0.591 and 0.502 mM, respectively. The binding affinities in the range from -8.4 to -9.5 kCal/mol were well predicted from docking, which showed a high linear correlation coefficient of 0.893 and Spearman correlation of 1.0 with log(IC50) values. Caffeoylquinic acid and its isomers were stabilized by hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction in the binding pocket. This finding provided molecular mechanism of coffee and other natural food or drink containing caffeoylquinic acid and its isomers against lipase activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Water consumption as a vital component of the human diet is under-researched in dietary surveys and nutrition studies. Aim: To assess total water and fluid intakes and examine demographic, anthropometric, and dietary factors associated with water consumption in the Australian population. Methods: Dietary intake data from the 2011 to 2012 National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey were used. Usual water, fluid and food and nutrient intakes were estimated from two days of dietary recalls. Total water includes plain drinking water and moisture from all food and beverage sources; total fluids include plain drinking water and other beverages, but not food moisture. Results: The mean (SD) daily total water intakes for children and adolescents aged 2-18 years were 1.7 (0.6) L for males and 1.5 (0.4) L for females, and for adults aged 19 years and over were 2.6 (0.9) L for males and 2.3 (0.7) L for females. The majority of the population failed to meet the Adequate Intake (AI) values for total water intake (82%) and total fluids intake (78%) with the elderly at highest risk (90%-95%). The contributions of plain drinking water, other beverages and food moisture to total water intake were 44%, 27%, and 29%, respectively, among children and adolescents, and 37%, 37% and 25% among adults. The main sources of other beverages were full-fat plain milk and regular soft drinks for children and adolescents, and tea, coffee, and alcoholic drinks for adults. For adults, higher total water intake was associated with lower percent energy from fat, saturated fat, and free sugars, lower sodium and energy-dense nutrient poor food intakes but higher dietary fibre, fruit, vegetable, caffeine, and alcohol intakes. No associations were found between total water consumption and body mass index (BMI) for adults and BMI z-score for children and adolescents. Conclusion: Reported water consumption was below recommendations. Higher water intakes were suggestive of better diet quality.

AB At present, the various medical treatments of obesity involve side effects. The aim of the research is therefore to find natural compounds that have anti-obesity activity with minimum disadvantages. In this study, the hypolipidemic effect of hydroalcoholic extract of flowers from Capsicum annuum L. was examined through the evaluation of inhibition of pancreatic lipase. Antioxidant activity was assessed using different tests: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), nitric oxide ((NO)-N-center dot) and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays. Phytochemical analysis indicated that total phenolic and flavonoid content in the extract was 128.7 +/- 4.5 mg chlorogenic acid equivalent/g of crude extract and 17.66 +/- 0.11 mg of quercetin equivalent/g of crude extract, respectively. The extract inhibited pancreatic lipase with IC50 value equal to 3.54 +/- 0.18 mg/ml. It also inhibited lipid peroxidation with IC50 value of 27.61 +/- 2.25 mu g/ml after 30 min of incubation and 41.69 +/- 1.13 mu g/ml after 60 min of incubation. The IC50 value of radical scavenging activity was 51.90 +/- 2.03 mu g/ml. The extract was also able to inhibit NO production (IC50 = of 264.3 +/- 7.98 mu g/ml) without showing any cytotoxic effect.

AB It is difficult to screen out as many active components as possible from natural plants all at one time. In this study, subfractions of Forsythia suspensa leaves were firstly prepared; then, their inhibitive abilities on pancreatic lipase were tested; finally, the highest inhibiting subfraction was screened by self-made immobilized pancreatic lipase. Results showed that nine ligands, including eight inhibitors and one promotor, were screened out all at one time. They were three flavonoids (rutin, IC50: 149 +/- 6.0 mu mol/L; hesperidin, 52.4 mu mol/L; kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, isolated from F. suspensa leaves for the first time, IC50 notably reached 2.9 +/- 0.5 mu mol/L), two polyphenols (chlorogenic acid, 3150 +/- 120 mu mol/L; caffeic acid, 1394 +/- 52 mu mol/L), two lignans (phillyrin, promoter; arctigenin, 2129 +/- 10.5 mu mol/L), and two phenethyl alcohol (forsythiaside A, 2155 +/- 8.5 mu mol/L; its isomer). Their action mechanisms included competitive inhibition, competitive promotion, noncompetitive inhibition, and uncompetitive inhibition. In sum, using the appropriate methods, more active ingredients can be simply and quickly screened out all at one time from a complex natural product system. In addition, F. suspensa leaves contain numerous inhibitors of pancreatic lipase.

AB Over the past two decades, many researchers have concluded that a diet rich in polyphenolic compounds plays an important therapeutic role in reducing the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, diabetes, and other degenerative diseases. Polyphenolic compounds have been reported to be involved in neutralization of reactive oxygen species and charged radicals, and have anti-carcinogenic effects, hepatoprotective effects, low-glycaemic response, and other benefits. The benefits of fruits and vegetables may be partly attributable to polyphenolic compounds, which have antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties. Fruits such as apples contain a variety of phytochemicals, including (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, phlorizin, phloretin quercetin, cyanidin-3-Ogalactoside, chlorogenic acid, and p-coumaric acid, all of which are strong antioxidants. Phloretin, a natural phenolic compound, is a dihydrochalcone, which is present in the apple. It exhibits a wide variety of activities such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-allergic, anticarcinogenic, anti-thrombotic, and hepatoprotective, besides being involved in the activation of apoptotic associated gene expression and signal transduction in molecular pathways. Despite a multitude of clinical studies, new efforts are needed in clinical research to determine the complete therapeutic potential of phloretin.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations among lifestyles, eating habits, nutritional status and intellectual capabilities of adolescents. A cross-sectional study was carried out using anthropometric measurements and standardized food questionnaire. The sample consisted of 151 adolescents attending a secondary school in central Serbia. Academic achievement was estimated through grade point average (GPA) in the previous academic year. Intellectual capabilities were expressed through intelligence quotient (IQ) determined by Cybernetic battery of intelligence (KOG 3). Totally, 14.5% of students were categorized as overweight or obese. No strong correlation was found between specific dietary habits and nutritional status of adolescents. The percentage of respondents with IQ>110 was higher in the group with increased body mass index (BMI percentile>85) compared to that in the group with normal body weight or underweight (38.5% vs. 15.7%). Besides, 16.7% of students with BMI percentile<85 and only 7.7% of students with BMI percentile>85 had IQ<90. However, Spearman con-elation coefficient indicated no strong correlation between IQ test results and students' BMI (rho=0.144). On the other hand, students with lower academic performance (GPA<3.5) were more prone to certain dietary habits such as frequent consumptions of coffee (p=0.002) and fast food (p=0.044). On the contrary, sedentary lifestyles were rather typical for adolescents with better academic achievements GPA>3.5 (p=0.009). A significant correlation was found between students' IQ and height (Spearman's p=0.352). Although there was no strong correlation between intellectual capabilities and nutritional status of adolescents, certain eating habits and lifestyles might be associated with intellectual performance.

AB Baccharis trimera (Less.) DC (gorse) is a plant popularly used for the treatment of obesity. In this study, we prepared three B.trimera extracts aqueous extract (AE), decoction (AE-D), and methanol extract (ME) and investigated their antioxidant effects in six different tests and their anti-adipogenic effect in 3T3-L1 cells. The extracts showed a dose-dependent antioxidant activity in all tests. AE was the most potent antioxidant in copper and ferric ion chelation assays, whereas AE-D was the most potent in superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays, reducing power assay, and total antioxidant capacity analysis. Only ME showed a cytotoxic effect against 3T3-L1 cells. Lipid accumulation decreased in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the presence of AE and AE-D extracts (0.5 to 1.0 mg/mL). In addition, the extracts dramatically attenuated the levels of adipogenic transcriptional factors, including CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha), CCAAT enhancer-binding protein fi (C/EBP fi), and gamma receptors by peroxisome proliferators (PPAR gamma), during adipogenesis. AE-D (1.0 mg/mL) caused an approximately 90% reduction in the levels of these molecules. We propose that B. trimera has an anti-adipogenic effect and could be used in the development of functional foods.

AB Background: Chile is the second world's largest per capita consumer of caloric beverages. Caloric beverages are associated with overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases. The objective of this study is to estimate the price elasticity of demand for soft drinks, other sugar-sweetened beverages and high-energy dense foods in urban areas in Chile in order to evaluate the potential response of households' consumption to changes in prices.
   Methods: We used microdata from the VII Family Budget Survey 2012-2013, which collects information on expenditures made by Chilean urban households on items such as beverages and foods. We estimated a Linear Approximation of an Almost Ideal Demand System Model to derive own and cross price elasticities of milk, coffee, tea and other infusions, plain water, soft drinks, other flavored beverages, sweet snacks, sugar and honey, and desserts. We considered the censored nature of the data and included the Inverse Mills Ratio in each equation of the demand system. We estimated a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System and a two-part model as sensitivity analysis.
   Results: We found an own price-elasticity of -1.37 for soft drinks. This implies that a price increase of 10% is associated with a reduction in consumption of 13.7%. We found that the rest of food and beverages included in the demand system behave as substitutes for soft drinks. For instance, plain water showed a cross-price elasticity of 0.63: a 10% increase in price of soft drinks could lead to an increase of 6.3% of plain water. Own and cross price elasticities were similar between models.
   Conclusions: The demand of soft drinks is price sensitive among Chilean households. An incentive system such as subsidies to non-sweetened beverages and tax to soft drinks could lead to increases in the substitutions for other healthier beverages.

AB BackgroundChlorogenic acids (CGAs) are widely distributed in plant material, including foods and beverages. 5-Caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA) is the most studied CGA, but the mechanism of its hypolipidaemic effect remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the effect of 5-CQA on lipid metabolism in the liver of Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD).
   Results5-CQA suppressed HFD-induced increases in body weight and visceral fat-pad weight, serum lipid levels, and serum and hepatic free fatty acids in a dose-dependent manner. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that 5-CQA altered the mRNA expression of the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and liver X receptor (LXR) and target genes involved in hepatic fatty acid uptake, -oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis. Moreover, hepatic tissue sections from HFD-fed rats showed many empty vacuoles, suggesting that liver cells were filled with more fat droplets. However, 5-CQA significantly ameliorated this effect.
   Conclusion5-CQA may improve lipid metabolism disorders by altering the expression of PPAR and LXR, which are involved in multiple intracellular signalling pathways. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Diabetes mellitus (DM) and consequential cardiovascular diseases lead to millions of deaths worldwide each year; 90% of all people suffering from DM are classified as Type 2 DM (T2DM) patients. T2DM is linked to insulin resistance and a loss of insulin sensitivity. It leads to a reduced uptake of glucose mediated by glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in muscle and adipose tissue, and finally hyperglycemia. Using a fluorescence microscopy-based screening assay we searched for herbal extracts that induce GLUT4 translocation in the absence of insulin, and confirmed their activity in chick embryos. We found that extracts prepared from Bellis perennis (common daisy) are efficient inducers of GLUT4 translocation in the applied in vitro cell system. In addition, these extracts also led to reduced blood glucose levels in chicken embryos (in ovo), confirming their activity in a living organism. Using high-performance liquid chromtaography (HPLC) analysis, we identified and quantified numerous polyphenolic compounds including apigenin glycosides, quercitrin and chlorogenic acid, which potentially contribute to the induction of GLUT4 translocation. In conclusion, Bellis perennis extracts reduce blood glucose levels and are therefore suitable candidates for application in food supplements for the prevention and accompanying therapy of T2DM.

AB Tea has been a very popular beverage around the world for centuries. The reason that it is delicious, enabling hydration, showing warming and relaxing effect can be mentioned why it is consumed so much in addition to its prominent health effects. Although the catechins and caffeine are the primary bioactive components that are related with the health effects of the tea, the health effects of theanine amino acid, which is a nonproteinic amino acid special to tea, has become prominent in recent years. It has been known that the theanine amino acid in tea has positive effects especially on relaxing, cognitive performance, emotional status, sleep quality, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and common cold. The results of acute and chronic toxicity tests conducted on the safety of theanine express that L-theanine is reliable in general even if it is consumed too much with diet. However, it has not revealed a clear evidence-based result yet regarding theanine metabolism, health effects, and its safety. Within this frame, chemical structure of theanine, its biosynthesis, dietary sources, metabolism, health effects, and safety are discussed in present study.

AB A new method for the screening of compounds with hypoglycemic effect from traditional Chinese medicines employing high-performance liquid chromatography and lipase-linked magnetic microspheres has been proposed. We hypothesized that the interaction of traditional Chinese medicine extracts with lipase-linked magnetic microspheres should decrease the concentration of compounds with hypoglycemic effect. Using this approach, the potential lipase inhibitors in Folium Mori extract were investigated. First, lipase was immobilized on magnetic microspheres by a chemical method. Then, by comparing the chromatograms of samples before and after the interaction with lipase-linked magnetic microspheres, seven compounds of Folium Mori extract were identified. It was found that protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, protocatechualdehyde, rutin, isoquercitrin, astragalin, and dicaffeoylquinic acid B had evident combination with lipase-linked magnetic microspheres. Their hypoglycemic effects were verified in streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. In the present study, astragalin was verified to improve the glucose tolerance and lower the level of glucose in streptozocin-induced diabetic mice, which indicated that astragalin might be a new highly efficient lipase inhibitor. Based on these significant results, this method could be a convenient approach to screen potential lipase inhibitors from traditional Chinese medicines. Meanwhile, it also could be expanded to screen other active compounds in traditional Chinese medicines.

AB Dietary habits are related to the risks of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, of which burdens are increasing in low-income countries including Ethiopia. Although several epidemiological studies of NCD risk factors were conducted in Ethiopia, qualitative studies on people's dietary habit in relation to NCDs have not been conducted yet. This study aims to describe people's perception and practice of 'healthy' diet, and barriers to practice 'healthy' diet, paying attention to the dynamics between the perception and practice. We conducted 16 key informant interviews and eight focus group discussions in an urban and a rural areas in northern Ethiopia between November 2014 and January 2016. Audio-records in local language were transcribed word-for-word, and translated into English. English text data were analyzed qualitatively, through constant comparative analysis following the principles of the grounded theory. Three themes have emerged: (1) dietary habit perceived as 'good' or 'bad' for health; (2) reasons for continuing current 'unhealthy' dietary habit; and (3) current dietary habit perceived as 'traditional.' People's practice was mostly consistent with their perception, while they sometimes practiced contrary to the perception because of personal preference and physical or financial obstacles. People were often indifferent of health implications of their habitual dietary practice, such as drinking a lot of sweet coffee. We showed dynamics between perception and practice of 'healthy' diet among people in northern Ethiopia. It is needed to increase awareness of NCDs both among the urban and rural people and to improve the social environment for removing the obstacles.

AB An imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species in the body can cause an increase of oxidative stress that leads to oxidative damage to cells and tissues, which culminates in the development or aggravation of some chronic diseases, such as inflammation, diabetes mellitus, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Secondary metabolites from Inula species can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of the oxidative stress-related diseases mentioned above. The databases Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science and the combining terms Inula, antioxidant and secondary metabolites were used in the research for this review. More than 120 articles are reviewed, highlighting the most active compounds with special emphasis on the elucidation of their antioxidative-stress mechanism of action, which increases the knowledge about their potential in the fight against inflammation, cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. Alantolactone is the most polyvalent compound, reporting interesting EC50 values for several bioactivities, while 1-O-acetylbritannilactone can be pointed out as a promising lead compound for the development of analogues with interesting properties. The Inula genus is a good bet as source of structurally diverse compounds with antioxidant activity that can act via different mechanisms to fight several oxidative stress-related human diseases, being useful for development of new drugs.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Numerous researches have studied the association between sugar intake and obesity of children in many countries. This study was undertaken to investigate the association between beverage intake and obesity of children by reviewing a database for total sugar contents established in all foods and presented in a nutrition survey by the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES).
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data of 1,520 children aged 6-11 years in the 6th KNHANES (2013-2015) were analyzed for this study. A database for total sugar intake comprises the total sugar contents of all foods included in the results of a nutrition survey using the 24-hour recall method of 6th KNHANES. Beverages were categorized into carbonated beverages, fruit & vegetable drinks, other drinks, tea, and coffee.
   RESULTS: The average daily beverage intake of all children was 131.75 g/day, and the average daily total sugar intake in beverages was 13.76 g/day. Carbonated beverages had the highest intake rate (58.85 g/day) and also ranked highest for sugar intake (6.36 g/day). After adjusting for confounding variables, the odds ratio for obesity in children with beverage intake of >= 200 mL/day significantly increased by 1.83 times (95% CI, 1.11-3.00) as compared to children with beverage intake of < 200 mL/day. Also, a significant increase was observed in the odds ratio for obesity in total children (2.41 times; 95% CI, 1.35-4.33) and boys (3.15 times; 95% CI, 1.53-6.49) with carbonated beverage intake of < 200 mL/day when compared with children who consumed >= 200 mL/day.
   CONCLUSION: A positive association is observed between beverage intake and obesity in Korean children. In particular, an intake of carbonated beverages has a positive correlation with childhood obesity in boys. This study can therefore be used as scientific evidence for reducing sugar, and for the continuous management and research on beverages.

AB Obesity is one of the principal human health problems and one of the main treatments against it is the inhibition of pancreatic lipase, the main responsible enzyme of lipid digestion. For that purpose, previous studies have tested several phenolic compounds against lipase, without considering their aggregation behavior in aqueous solutions. Because of this, the present study focuses on understanding how the solubility and the presence of particles affect the IC50 value of the interaction between lipase and phenolic compounds present in beverages like fruit juices and teas. Therefore, the inhibitory capacity against pancreatic lipase and the aggregate formation of 9 phenolic compounds (quercetin, rutin, myricetin, catechin, epigallocatechin gallate, cyanidin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and vanillic acid) were analyzed. The results obtained together with the solubility data from literature were treated by principal component analysis and indicate that the IC50 value does not correlate with the solubility or aggregate formation of the phenolic compounds. However, the IC50 values of phenolic compounds which aggregate during the assay conditions have low reproducibility. This study shows that the aggregate formation of phenolic compounds plays an important role during in vitro assays for pancreatic lipase inhibition and should be considered in future experiments as it can lead to false positive results. In terms of particle formation, the flavonoids investigated in this study are more prone to aggregation compared to the phenolic acids.

AB Chinese residents enjoy various types of beverages in their daily life. With the rapid Westernization of contemporary China, several adverse health concerns-such as diabetes linked to sweetened beverages-have emerged. Until now, no research that examines associations between beverage consumption and smoking/drinking behaviors has been made available, despite the large Chinese populations partaking in such activities. We conducted a cross-sectional study to explore the association between beverage intake frequencies and smoking/drinking behaviors in 12,634 adult respondents who participated in the latest wave (2011) of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). Further, we applied Tukey's Honest Significance test for pairwise comparisons. We defined the consumption categories as daily (at least one serving per day), weekly (less than one serving per day, at least one serving per week), monthly (less than one serving per week, at least one serving per month), and less than monthly or none-for sweetened beverage, water, tea, and coffee consumptions. The data showed that both tea and sweetened beverages are associated with smoking/drinking behaviors. Compared to respondents who consume tea and sweetened beverages daily, the odds of smoking behaviors are lower for those who consume such beverages less frequently. Further policy implications are discussed, including higher taxes on sweetened beverages and lessons from other countries.

AB Epidemiological studies have found that a diet high in fibre and coffee, but low in red meat, reduces the risk for type 2 diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that these nutritional modifications differentially improve whole-body insulin sensitivity (primary outcome) and secretion.
   Inclusion criteria were: age 18-69 years, BMI a parts per thousand yen30 kg/m(2), type 2 diabetes treated with diet, metformin or acarbose and known disease duration of a parts per thousand currency sign5 years. Exclusion criteria were: HbA(1c) > 75 mmol/mol (9.0%), type 1 or secondary diabetes types and acute or chronic diseases including cancer. Patients taking any medication affecting the immune system or insulin sensitivity, other than metformin, were also excluded. Of 59 patients (randomised using randomisation blocks [four or six patients] with consecutive numbers), 37 (54% female) obese type 2 diabetic patients completed this controlled parallel-group 8-week low-energy dietary intervention. The participants consumed either a diet high in cereal fibre (whole grain wheat/rye: 30-50 g/day) and coffee (a parts per thousand yen5 cups/day), and free of red meat (L-RISK, n = 17) or a diet low in fibre (a parts per thousand currency sign10 g/day), coffee-free and high in red meat (a parts per thousand yen150 g/day) diet (H-RISK, n = 20). Insulin sensitivity and secretion were assessed by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp and intravenous glucose tolerance tests with isotope dilution. Whole-body and organ fat contents were measured by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy.
   Whole-body insulin sensitivity increased in both groups (mean [95% CI]) (H-RISK vs L-RISK: 0.8 [0.2, 1.4] vs 1.0 [0.4, 1.7] mg kg(-1) min(-1), p = 0.59), while body weight decreased (-4.8% [-6.1%, -3.5%] vs -4.6% [-6.0%, -3.3%], respectively). Hepatic insulin sensitivity remained unchanged, whereas hepatocellular lipid content fell in both groups (-7.0% [-9.6%, -4.5%] vs -6.7% [-9.5%, -3.9%]). Subcutaneous fat mass (-1,553 [-2,767, -340] cm(3) vs -751 [-2,047; 546] cm(3), respectively) visceral fat mass (-206 [-783, 371] cm(3) vs -241 [-856, 373] cm(3), respectively) and muscle fat content (-0.09% [-0.16%, -0.02%] vs -0.02% [-0.10%, 0.05%], respectively) decreased similarly. Insulin secretion remained unchanged, while the proinflammatory marker IL-18 decreased only after the L-RISK diet.
   No evidence of a difference between both low-energy diets was identified. Thus, energy restriction per se seems to be key for improving insulin action in phases of active weight loss in obese type 2 diabetic patients, with a potential improvement of subclinical inflammation with the L-RISK diet.

AB As the use of beverages in diets is increasing, several studies have examined the effect of beverage consumption in human health. Thus, we aimed at identifying specific beverage patterns and determining their associations with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors in Korean adults. Based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2008-2012 data, 19,800 Korean adults (20 years) with a single 24-h dietary recall and health examination data were investigated. All beverage items consumed by participants were categorized into 15 beverage groups based on the KNHANES coding system. Three major beverage consumption patterns were identified according to factor analysis: (1) the healthy beverage (high intake of dairy products, 100% fruit/vegetable juices and low intake of alcoholic beverages); (2) the sugar-sweetened beverage (high intake of soda, sweetened coffee/tea, and fruit drink); and (3) the unsweetened beverage (high intake of unsweetened coffee) patterns. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the odds of obesity (body mass index 25kg/m(2)) and MetS (defined by National Cholesterol Education Program III [NCEP III]) for each beverage pattern after controlling for covariates. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of the healthy beverage pattern with risks of obesity, abdominal obesity, and elevated triglycerides, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and blood pressure (BP) were 0.88 (0.79-0.98), 0.83 (0.74-0.92), 0.88 (0.78-0.99), 0.85 (0.79-0.98), and 0.81 (0.72-0.92), respectively. AORs (95% CIs) of associations of the sugar-sweetened beverage pattern with risks of abdominal obesity, elevated FBG and BP were 1.15 (1.03-1.30), 1.14 (1.01-1.29), and 1.18 (1.04-1.33), respectively. However, no associations were found between the unsweetened beverage pattern and any parameters examined. Intake of healthy beverages should be encouraged to reduce risks of obesity and metabolic abnormalities; however, individuals who consume sugar-sweetened beverages should be advised on the adverse effects of those beverages on the risk of obesity and MetS.

AB The worldwide consumption of energy drinks (EDs) has increased in recent years. EDs have several side effects and can be linked to liver injury, kidney damage and risk-seeking behavior. The impact of perinatal consumption of EDs on the newborns has not been previously investigated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of perinatal exposure to a caffeinated ED on the liver, kidney, brain, locomotor activity and anxiety in mice newborns. Pregnant mice received 2.5 or 5 ml ED by oral gavage from the first day of pregnancy until day 15 after birth. Perinatal exposure to the ED induced a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and declined antioxidant defenses in the liver, kidney, cerebrum, cerebellum and medulla oblongata of the newborns at days 21 and 35 after birth. ED induced several histological alterations, including vacuolations and lipid infiltration of hepatocytes, developing and degenerated glomeruli and dilated urinary spaces in the renal cortex, pyknosis and chromatolysis of the cerebral and medullary neurons, and degenerated and abnormal Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. In addition, ED increased the locomotion and induced anxiety-like behavior in mice newborns. In conclusion, perinatal exposure to EDs induces oxidative stress, tissue injury and behavioral alterations in the mice newborns. Therefore, the consumption of EDs during pregnancy and lactation has a negative impact on the newborns and should be treated as a significant health problem that warrants attention.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: The dry ripe fruit of the Akebia quinata (A. quinata) plant is used as an analgesic, an antiphlogistic, and a diuretic in traditional medicine. A. quinata has also been used in Korea as a crude drug for treating obesity. The aim of the study was to determine the anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects of A. quinata extract (AQE) in mice consuming a high-fat diet and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
   Materials and methods: We measured obesity-related physiological parameters, gene expression, and protein phosphorylation in mice consuming a high-fat diet supplemented with AQE (400 mg/kg/day) for 6.5 weeks.
   Results: AQE reduced gain in body weight, adipose tissue weight, and serum lipid levels in mice consuming a high-fat diet. AQE supplementation reduced expression of genes related to adipogenesis and increased expression of PPAR alpha, acetyl-CoA oxidase, and adiponectin in the epididymal adipose tissue. Furthermore, AQE increased phospholylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, both of which are related to fatty acid oxidation, in vivo. HPLC analysis revealed that AQE contained chlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid A, and isochlorogenic acid C. AQE and all of these constituents inhibited differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and enhanced AMPK phosphorylation.

AB BackgroundSchool nutrition policies can encourage restrictions in sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) availability in school food outlets in order to discourage students' SSB intake. The main objective was to examine how beverage availability in school vending machines changes over three school years across schools in distinct school nutrition policy contexts. Secondary objectives were to examine how students' weekday SSB intake varies with time and identify longitudinal associations between beverage availability and SSB intake.MethodsThis longitudinal study used data from the COMPASS study (2013/14-2015/16), representing 7679 students from 78 Canadian secondary schools and three provincial school nutrition policy contexts (Alberta - voluntary guidelines, Ontario public - mandatory guidelines, and Ontario private schools - no guidelines). We assessed availability of 10 beverage categories in schools' vending machines via the COMPASS School Environment Application and participants' intake of three SSB varieties (soft drinks, sweetened coffees/teas, and energy drinks) via a questionnaire. Hierarchical regression models were used to examine whether: i) progression of time and policy group were associated with beverage availability; and, ii) beverage availability was associated with students' SSB intake.ResultsOntario public schools were significantly less likely than the other policy groups to serve SSBs in their vending machines, with the exception of flavoured milks. Vending machine beverage availability was consistent over time. Participants' overall SSB intake remained relatively stable; reductions in soft drink intake were partially offset by increased sweetened coffee/tea consumption. Relative to Ontario public schools, attending school in Alberta was associated with more frequent energy drink intake and overall SSB intake whereas attending an Ontario private school was associated with less frequent soft drink intake, with no differences in overall SSB intake. Few beverage availability variables were significantly associated with participants' SSB intake.ConclusionsMandatory provincial school nutrition policies were predictive of more limited SSB availability in school vending machines. SSB intake was significantly lower in Ontario public and private schools, although we did not detect a direct association between SSB consumption and availability. The findings provide support for mandatory school nutrition policies, as well as the need for comprehensive school- and broader population-level efforts to reduce SSB intake.

AB Background: Children's beverage consumption patterns have received increased attention in light of the obesity epidemic in this group. In day care centers (DCCs), children spend up to 10 h a day, and typically consume half to three quarters of their daily food intake. The purpose of the study was to investigate what beverages are typically served to children in preschools in Poland, and to evaluate the practices associated with adding sugar and other sweetening agents to beverages. Methods: Direct interviews with preschools staff were conducted with a questionnaire regarding offered beverages and adding sugar and other sweetening agents. The menu of 10 consecutive days and inventory reports were analyzed to verify information. Results: A total of 720 preschools were included in the study. Cocoa and milk coffee substitute were served in 95% of preschools, followed by compote (92%), tea (84%), fruit/herbal tea (73%) and water (69%). Water was the only beverage available between meals (93% DCCs). 86% of preschools added sugar to tea/cocoa/coffee substitute drinks, and 74% to compote. Conclusions: In the majority of preschools, beverages which are not recommended were offered. Such an assortment of beverages and common practice of sweetening can increase the amount of added sugar in a children diet. Nutrition education and legal regulations concerning the assortment of beverages served in preschools are urgently needed.

AB Cardiovascular diseases are the greatest cause of death globally and are frequently associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome, a condition including visceral obesity, hypertension, elevated triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol and hyperglycaemia. Several medicinal plants, including spices, are used in Cameroon as herbal medicines and are traditionally employed for the treatment of several ailments such as diabetes and related diseases. In this study, we chemically characterized eleven Cameroonian spice extracts and evaluated their effects on some enzyme activities relevant to carbohydrate and lipid digestion and cardio-metabolic diseases. Hydroethanolic spice extracts were characterized by GC-MS analysis and screened for their ability to modulate the activity of alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, pancreatic lipase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Among the spice extracts tested, those from Xylopia parviflora showed the widest inhibitory spectrum, with a relevant effect on all enzyme activities. Dichrostachys glomerata and Aframomum citratum extracts were more selective. The selected and strong activity of some plants, such as that of Aframomum citratum on pancreatic lipase and that of Xylopia aethiopica on ACE, suggests their specific use in obesity and hypertension, respectively. Chemical analysis indicated that for some spice extracts such as Xylopia parviflora and Aframomum citratum their secondary metabolites (chlorogenic acid, pimaric acid, and catechin and its derivatives) could potentially justify the biological properties observed. Our findings clearly show significant inhibition of cardio-metabolic enzymes by hydroethanolic Cameroonian spice extracts, suggesting the potential usefulness of nutraceuticals derived from these plants to develop novel management strategies for obesity and diabetes complications.

AB Sibiraea angustata leaves, known as a traditional Tibetan medicine, have been specially used in the treatment of indigestion and obesity. In the study, a simple and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with a diode array detector (DAD) was established to solve the problem of lacking quality standard of S. angustata leaves, including the fingerprint analysis and quantification of six characteristic components. The analytical method was validated for linearity, repeatability, stability, recovery, and specificity. Seventeen raw samples and 1 processed sample of S. angustata leaves were collected from different locations of China to establish the fingerprint. The chemometric methods, including similarity analysis (SA), principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), were applied to distinguish the 18 batches of S. angustata samples. The results successfully sorted these samples into five clusters and kept in line with each other. According to the result of the fingerprint analysis, 21 peaks were extracted to be the common peaks and most of them were identified by mass spectrometry (MS) with electron-spray ionization (ESI) in the negative mode. Meanwhile, the loading plot of PCA further indicated that the peaks of neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, rutin, hyperin, and isoquercitrin played a greater role in the discrimination among the 21 peaks. So the six components mentioned above were investigated as index constituents to evaluate the quality of S. angustata leaves from different locations. The study demonstrated that the developed new method was a beneficial approach for authentication and quality evaluation of S. angustata leaves.

AB Aim Drinks can contribute to energy as well as micro- and macro-nutrient intake. Drink-specific, validated, quick and easy to administer questionnaires are needed to monitor secular trends in beverage consumption for different populations. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to develop and validate a drink-specific questionnaire for the Greek population. Methods A 41-item semi-quantitative drinks frequency questionnaire (DFQ) was developed and validated against 7-day weighed food records, among young Greek adults. Wilcoxon ranks tests, Kendall tau-b correlations and Bland-Altman plot were used to compare the two methods. Fifty-nine Greek University students (28 males, 31 females) completed both methods. Results No difference was observed in total drinks intake between the two methods. The Bland-Altman plot showed that the two methods are likely to agree concerning the total drinks intake. Wilcoxon's rank test showed no significant differences between the two methods, except for the 'whiskey/vodka/gin' intake (P < 0.001). 'Good' agreement (tau-b > 0.61) was observed for most DFQ items, including low-fat and chocolate milk, hot chocolate, Greek/espresso coffee, commercial tea, packaged fruit juices, wine, alcohol-free beer, light cola-type drinks and water (tap/bottled/sparkling). 'Low' agreement (<0.30) was noted for filtered/instant/iced coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice and some alcoholic drinks (beer/whiskey/vodka/gin). Conclusions The DFQ appears to be an overall valid means of estimating the habitual intake of drinks in large-scale epidemiological surveys. The study supports the use of DFQ for assessing drinks consumption patterns and secular trends.

AB Objective: The present paper reports on a quality improvement activity examining implementation of A Better Choice Healthy Food and Drink Supply Strategy for Queensland Health Facilities (A Better Choice). A Better Choice is a policy to increase supply and promotion of healthy foods and drinks and decrease supply and promotion of energy-dense, nutrient-poor choices in all food supply areas including food outlets, staff dining rooms, vending machines, tea trolleys, coffee carts, leased premises, catering, fundraising, promotion and advertising.
   Design: An online survey targeted 278 facility managers to collect self-reported quantitative and qualitative data. Telephone interviews were sought concurrently with the twenty-five A Better Choice district contact officers to gather qualitative information.
   Setting: Public sector-owned and -operated health facilities in Queensland, Australia.
   Subjects:One hundred and thirty-four facility managers and twenty-four district contact officers participated with response rates of 48.2 % and 96.0 %, respectively.
   Results: Of facility managers, 78.4 % reported implementation of more than half of the A Better Choice requirements including 24.6 % who reported full strategy implementation. Reported implementation was highest in food outlets, staff dining rooms, tea trolleys, coffee carts, internal catering and drink vending machines. Reported implementation was more problematic in snack vending machines, external catering, leased premises and fundraising.
   Conclusions: Despite methodological challenges, the study suggests that policy approaches to improve the food and drink supply can be implemented successfully in public-sector health facilities, although results can be limited in some areas. A Better Choice may provide a model for improving food supply in other health and workplace settings.

AB Background: The Samoan population has been undergoing a nutrition transition toward more imported and processed foods and a more sedentary lifestyle.
   Objectives: We aimed to identify dietary patterns in Samoa and to evaluate their associations with metabolic outcomes.
   Methods: The sample of this cross-sectional study includes 2774 Samoan adults recruited in 2010 (1104 with metabolic syndrome compared with 1670 without). Principal component analysis on food items from a 104-item food-frequency questionnaire was used to identify dietary patterns. Adjusted least squares means of each component of metabolic syndrome were estimated by quintiles of factor scores for each dietary pattern. Metabolic syndrome status was regressed on quintiles of scores by using log-binomial models to obtain prevalence ratios.
   Results: We identified a modern pattern, a mixed-traditional pattern, and a mixed-modern pattern. The modern pattern included a high intake of imported and processed foods, including pizza, cheeseburgers, margarine, sugary drinks, desserts, snacks, egg products, noodles, nuts, breads, and cakes and a low intake of traditional agricultural products and fish. The mixed-traditional pattern had a high intake of neotraditional foods, including fruits, vegetables, soup, poultry, and fish, and imported and processed foods, including dairy products, breads, and cakes. The mixed-modern pattern was loaded with imported and processed foods, including pizza, cheeseburgers, red meat, egg products, noodles, and grains, but also with neotraditional foods, such as seafood and coconut. It also included a low intake of fish, tea, coffee, soup, and traditional agricultural staples. Higher adherence to the mixed-modern pattern was associated with lower abdominal circumference (P-trend < 0.0001), lower serum triglycerides (P-trend = 0.03), and higher serum HDL cholesterol (P-trend = 0.0003). The mixed-modern pattern was inversely associated with prevalence of metabolic syndrome (the highest quintile: prevalence ratio = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.91; P-trend = 0.006).
   Conclusion: Mixed dietary patterns containing healthier foods, rather than a largely imported and processed modern diet, may help prevent metabolic syndrome in Samoa.

AB Context Phillyrea latifolia L. (Oleaceae), commonly found in the Mediterranean region in Turkey, is used as medicinal teas for weight loss and hyperglycaemia in folk medicine.
   Objective The study investigated the possible effects of P. latifolia leaves aqueous extract's on weight loss and biochemical-histological changes in the rats fed a high-energy diet (HED), also isolated and determined the main phenolic compounds.
   Materials and methods Twenty-four male Wistar albino rats were divided into four equal groups such as the HED group fed a HED, the PLE group given only the extract of P. latifolia leaves (220 mg/kg), the HED + PLE group administrated with the extract of leaves ( 220 mg/kg) after being fed with HED and a control group fed with standard pellet diet.
   Results PLE administration caused a remarkable decrement of body weight in the HED + PLE group (p < 0.05). PLE showed an improved effect on structural integrity and decreased leukocyte infiltration in liver and small intestinal tissues. The blood glucose (117.3 mmol/L), leptin (5.6 ng/mL), total cholesterol (61.8 mg/dL) and LDL (9.3 mmol/L) levels were significantly increased in the HED group. PLE administration in the HED group decreased these levels. The levels of HDL (26.8 mmol/L) in the HED + PLE group were higher than both control and HED groups. Chemical composition was investigated and luteolin 7-O-glucoside and chlorogenic acid were determined for the first time in Turkish sample from the EtOAc extract of leaves.
   Discussion and conclusion Phillyrea latifolia leaves may have beneficial effects on obesity related cellular problems and may become a good source of antidiabetic medication.

AB We examined whether the incorporation of green tea extract enriched rye bread (GTRB) into the diet can improve weight loss (WL) maintenance and control of abnormalities linked to metabolic syndrome (MS). A total of 55 obese men and women (mean age: 53.0 +/- 7.0 years, body mass index: 35.0 +/- 5.5 kg m(-2)) were recruited. The study had a single-blind randomized study design and consisted of an 8-week WL phase with low-energy calorie diet, followed by a 12-week weight maintenance (WM) phase. During the WM phase, the subjects were randomized into two groups, receiving either the control rye bread (control group) or the GTRB (intervention group). The ingestion of 280 and 360 g GTRB provided daily totals of 123.2 and 158.4 mg caffeine, and 188.3 and 242.1 mg of epigallocatechin gallate, for women and men, respectively. After the WL phase, subjects lost 7.3 +/- 3.1 kg of their baseline body weight. GTRB intake did not significantly influence the maintenance of WL, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose concentrations. Although, it resulted in significant differences (mean difference [95% confidence interval]) between the treatment groups in the maintenance of waist circumference (-1.22 cm [-2.4, -0.02; P=.04]), the results were not clinically meaningful. Nevertheless, the ingestion of GTRB led to the maintenance of lower blood pressure (BP), also the proportion of subjects fulfilling the criteria of MS after the WM phase was lower in the intervention group than in the control group. Although GTRB consumption did not improve significantly the WL maintenance, it resulted in a better control of BP.

ID GREEN COFFEE EXTRACT
AB The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of a sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seed extract, standardized for 40% chlorogenic acids on weight and body composition of obese adults. Fifty subjects were randomly assigned to sunflower extract or isocaloric placebo groups, receiving respectively 500 mg/day of treatment for 12 weeks. At the end of the intervention, a significant decrease in body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), and waist circumference was observed, especially for obese female subjects above 30 years. Those changes were associated with modified body composition related to fat mass loss. A decrease in blood cholesterol was also observed, supporting the potential action of sunflower extract on lipid metabolism. It was concluded that consumption of sunflower extract has a beneficial effect on body weight, fat mass, and lipid profile, providing evidence for its use as a natural anti-obesity herbal extract.

AB This study aims (i) to verify expression of the UCPs, PLIN1, PPARG2, and ADRB3 genes in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese women at baseline and after 8 weeks of supplementation with decaffeinated green tea extract, and (ii) to associate findings with clinical parameters. This is a longitudinal study during which 11 women with obesity grade III were submitted to supplementation with 450 mg of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (intervention group); the control group consisted of 10 eutrophic women. Anthropometric parameters [weight, height, and body mass index (BMI)], resting metabolic rate (RMR, measured by indirect calorimetry), and gene expression (measured by real-time PCR, RT-qPCR) were determined before and after supplementation. After 8 weeks, clinical parameters and UCP1, PLIN1, PPARG2, and ADRB3 expression remained unaltered in the intervention group (p > .05). Genetic analysis also showed that the UCP3 gene was upregulated (p = .026), but its upregulation did not promote weight loss.

AB Catechins in green tea are well-known to be effective in reducing the risk of obesity. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of catechins present in green tea on adipocyte differentiation and mature adipocyte metabolism. Treatment of 3T3-L1 mouse adipocyte during differentiation adipocytes with (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and gallic acid (GA) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of adipogenesis. Specifically, EGC increased adiponectin and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) transcription in mature adipocytes. Transcription levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) were not significantly impacted by either of the compounds. These results suggest that the EGC is the most effective catechin having anti-obesity activity. Finally, EGC is an attractive candidate component for remodeling obesity.

AB Growing evidence support that insulin resistance may occur as a severe problem due to chronic energetic overfeeding and subsequent obesity. When an abundance of glucose and saturated fat enter the cell, impaired blood flow, hypoxia, inflammation and macrophage infiltration in obese adipose tissue may induce oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Excessive circulating saturated fatty acids ectopically accumulate in insulin-sensitive tissues and impair insulin action. In this context, excessive hepatic lipid accumulation may play a central, pathogenic role in insulin resistance. It is thought that dietary polyphenols may ameliorate obesity-related insulin resistance by attenuating inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. The most often occurring natural polyphenolic compounds are flavonoids. In this review, the possible mechanistic effect of flavonoid-rich natural products on insulin resistance-related metabolic pathways is discussed. Polyphenol intake can prevent high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance via cell surface G protein-coupled estrogen receptors by upregulating the expression of related genes, and their pathways, which are responsible for the insulin sensitivity.

AB Background A majority of Americans consume beverages and discretionary foods - foods that are typically low in nutrient value but high in sugar, sodium, fats, and cholesterol-as part of their daily diet, which profoundly impacts their energy balance and nutritional status.
   Objective This study examined consumption of different types of beverages in relation to discretionary food intake and diet quality among US adults.
   Methods Nationally representative sample of 22,513 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2012 waves were analyzed. The discretionary food category identifies energy-dense, nutrient-poor food products that do not necessarily provide essential nutrients that the human body needs, but can add variety. First-difference estimator addressed confounding bias from time-invariant unobservables (eg, eating habits, taste preferences) by using within-individual variations in diet and beverage consumption between 2 nonconsecutive 24-hour dietary recalls.
   Results Approximately 21.7%, 42.9%, 52.8%, 26.3%, and 22.2% of study participants consumed diet beverage, sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB), coffee, tea, and alcohol, respectively, and 90.1% consumed discretionary foods on any given day. Across beverage types, alcohol (384.8 kcal) and SSB (226.2 kcal) consumption was associated with the largest increase in daily total calorie intake; coffee (60.7 kcal) and diet-beverage (48.8 kcal) consumption was associated with the largest increase in daily calorie intake from discretionary foods, and SSB consumption was associated with the largest reduction in daily overall diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating Index 2010. The impact of beverage consumption on daily calorie intake (overall and from discretionary foods) and diet quality differed across individual sociodemographics and body-weight status. The incremental daily calorie intake from discretionary foods associated with diet-beverage consumption was highest in obese adults, and that associated with SSB was highest in normal-weight adults.
   Conclusions Interventions to promote healthy eating should assess beverage consumption in the context of overall dietary behavior.

AB Background & aims: Associations of dietary sugars with metabolic and inflammatory markers may vary according to the source of the sugars. The aim of this study was to examine the association of dietary sugars from different sources [beverages (liquids), foods (solids), extrinsic (free) or intrinsic (non-free)] with metabolic and inflammatory markers.
   Methods: Population-based cross-sectional study of adults in the East of England (n = 9678). Sugar intakes were estimated using food frequency questionnaires. Fasting glycated haemoglobin, glucose, insulin, and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) were measured and indices of metabolic risk were derived (homeostatic model of insulin resistance, HOMA-IR and metabolic risk z-score).
   Results: In multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders including BMI and TEI, sugars from liquids were positively associated with In-CRP [b-coefficient (95%CI), 0.14 (0.05,0.22) per 10% TEI] and metabolic risk z-score [0.13 (0.07,0.18)]. Free sugars were positively associated with In-HOMA-IR [0.05 (0.03,0.08)] and metabolic risk z-score [0.09 (0.06,0.12)]. Sugars from solids were not associated with any outcome. Among major dietary contributors to intakes (g/d), sugars in fruit, vegetables, dairy products/egg dishes, cakes/biscuits/confectionary and squash/juice drinks were not associated, but sugar added to tea, coffee, cereal was significantly positively associated with all outcomes. Sugars in 100% juice [0.16 (0.06,0.25) per 10%TEI] and other non-alcoholic beverages [0.13 (0.03,0.23)] were positively associated with metabolic risk z-score.
   Conclusion: Higher intakes of sugars from non-alcoholic beverages and sugar added to tea, coffee, cereal were associated with glycaemia and inflammatory markers. Sugars from solids were not associated, irrespective of whether they were intrinsic or extrinsic. Positive associations of free sugars were largely explained by contribution of beverages to intake.

AB This study aim to evaluate the effect of Casimiroa edulis and Crataegus pubescens aqueous extracts on cardiac lipotoxicity in obese rats. Both extracts decrease cardiac hypertrophy and steatosis in high fat and fructose (HFF)-diet-fed obese rats. C. pubescens decreases the cardiac content of 16 and 18 carbon-length fatty acids, whereas C. edulis extract does not alter the fatty acid profile. Regarding lipotoxic compounds, C. pubescens reduces the cardiac content of 16 and 18 carbon-length ceramides and diacylglycerols, whereas C. edulis extract reduces >= 20 carbon-length lipotoxic compounds. Both extracts down-regulate fatty acid synthase (Fasn) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acaca) (lipogenesis), glyceril-3-phosphate acyltransferase (Gpat) (diacylglycerol synthesis) and serine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Spt1) (ceramide synthesis), and up-regulate carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1) and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadm) (beta-oxidation), and the greatest effect is observed with C. pubescens. In addition, C. edulis exerts the greatest cardiac anti-inflammatory activity, whereas C. pubescens shows the highest cardiac antioxidant activity. The cardioprotective effect of C. pubescens may be associated with its content of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and beta-campesterol, whereas the beneficial effect of C. edulis may be related to its high content of steroidal saponins and alkaloids. Therefore, these results demonstrate that both herbal aqueous extracts ameliorate cardiac lipotoxicity in HFF-diet-fed rats, and C. pubescens exerts a greater beneficial effect. Practical Applications: This study proposes the characterization of fatty acids and lipotoxic compounds (ceramides and diacylglycerols) of cardiac tissue in combination with the determination of the expression of specific genes related to lipid metabolism to identify the mechanisms associated with the cardioprotective effects of herbal extracts. The results obtained in this study demonstrate the cardioprotective potential of Casimiroa edulis and Crataegus pubescens aqueous extracts through the modulation of cardiac lipid metabolism in high fat and fructose diet fed obese rats. Therefore, these herbs can be used for the development of functional beverages or the extraction of bioactive compounds with cardioprotective effect.

AB Obesity is a critical health issue worldwide. For a long time, the concept of drinking tea for health and pleasure is widely accepted. The strain of Andraca theae lives on the tea leaf and the bioactivity of its metabolites in the feces is unknown yet. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate whether the extract of tea (Taiwan Tea Experiment Station No.12 (TE)) and its metabolites from Andraca theae (TME) could prevent obesity in the high fat diet-induced obese rats. Our results showed that TE had higher concentrations of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and caffeine than that from TME. TE significantly decreased abdominal adipose tissue, especially epididymal fat via increasing preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX-9) and decreasing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)beta, C/EBP alpha and C/EBP gamma protein expression. Taken together, these results suggest that the content of tea polyphenols in TE play an important role for alleviating abdominal fat. (C) 2018 "Society information".

AB Tea, a popular beverage made from leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis, has been studied extensively in recent decades for its beneficial health effects in the prevention of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases. Whereas these beneficial effects have been convincingly demonstrated in most laboratory studies, results from human studies have not been consistent. Some studies demonstrated that weight reduction, alleviation of metabolic syndrome and risk reduction in diabetes were only observed in individuals who consume 3-4 cups of tea (600-900 mg tea catechins) or more daily. This chapter reviews some of these studies, the possible mechanisms of actions of tea constituents, and the challenges in extrapolating laboratory studies to human situations.

AB Background and Objective: Role of green tea constituents in enhancing adipose Mesoderm Specific Transcript (MEST) expression of obese rats has not investigated yet. Evaluation of their effects on lipid profile, MEST expression and oxidative biomarkers were main objective of the current study. Materials and Methods: About 60 rats used in the current experiment (32 weeks) and divided into two unequal groups. Rats of the first group (n = 10) was negative control and fed basal diet (C). Rats of the second group (n = 50) was positive control, fed high fat diet and divided into five equal treatments (T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5). Rats of T1 were positive control and fed high fat diet. Rats of T2-T5 fed high fat diet mixed with green tea, Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), polyphenol 60 and EGCG+caffeine, respectively. Results: High fat diet elevated total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TAG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), malondialdehyde (MDA) and MEST gene expression and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST). Green tea or its constituents particularly EGCG restored the changed values towards the negative control. Conclusion:These results concluded that EGCG might be potential therapy against obesity over whole herb or other studied constituents.

AB Leptin is mainly secreted by white adipose tissue and regulates energy homeostasis by inhibiting food intake and stimulating energy expenditure through its action in neuronal circuits in the brain, particularly in the hypothalamus. However, hyperleptinemia coexists with the loss of responsiveness to leptin in common obese conditions. This phenomenon has been defined as leptin resistance and the restoration of leptin sensitivity is considered to be a useful strategy to treat obesity. This review summarizes the existing literature on potentially valuable nutrients and food components to reverse leptin resistance. Notably, several food compounds, such as teasaponins, resveratrol, celastrol, caffeine, and taurine among others, are able to restore the leptin signaling in neurons by overexpressing anorexigenic peptides (proopiomelanocortin) and/or repressing orexigenic peptides (neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide), thus decreasing food intake. Additionally, some nutrients, such as vitamins A and D, can improve leptin transport through the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, food components can improve leptin resistance by acting at different levels of the leptin pathway; moreover, some compounds are able to target more than one feature of leptin resistance. However, systematic studies are necessary to define the actual effectiveness of each compound.

AB Obesity and its associated cardiometabolic alterations currently are considered an epidemic; thus, their treatment is of major importance. The cornerstone for such treatment involves therapeutic lifestyle changes; however, the vast majority of cases fail and/or significant weight loss is maintained only in the short term because of lack of compliance. The popularity of dietary supplements for weight management has increased, and a wide variety of these products are available over the counter. However, the existing scientific evidence is insufficient to recommend their safe use. Hence, the purpose of this article is to review the clinical effects, proposed mechanism of action, and safety profile of some of the new dietary supplements, including white bean extract, Garcinia cambogia, bitter orange, Hoodia gordonii, forskolin, green coffee, glucomannan, beta-glucans, chitosan, guar gum, and raspberry ketones.

AB In recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying food-originated phytocompounds with beneficial influences for humans. Amongst the most active natural substances are polyphenols, for which high content has been identified in the Viburnum opulus berry, and which are unused in Western Europe. Due to its strong antioxidant activity we explored the potential of V. opulus as a preventive agent against diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Among the causes of these ailments is oxidative stress, as well as impaired glucose and free fatty acids (FFA) uptake. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine biological activity of V. opulus phenolic extracts as cytoprotective agents able to decrease induced oxidative stress, lower lipid accumulation and attenuate glucose and FFA uptake by Caco-2 cells via GLUT2 and CD36/FAT transporters. To determine the source of the most biologically active phenolic compounds, we obtained four phenolic compounds extracts as crude juice, phenolics isolated from juice and two preparations of phenolics obtained with different extraction agents from fruit pomace. Among the studied extracts, the phenolic rich fraction obtained from fruit juice revealed the strongest activity to decrease uptake of glucose, FFA and accumulation of lipid droplets in Caco-2 cells without affecting their viability (IC0 50 mu g/mL). Observed uptake attenuation was followed by decrease of the CD36/FAT gene expression, without influence on the GLUT2 and PPAR alpha levels. We suspect that V. opulus phenolics were able to modulate the cellular membrane dynamic, although that hypothesis requires further, more detailed studies. Extracts revealed strong chemo-preventive activity against oxidative stress induced chemically by tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH), as well as against DNA damage through the induction of DNA repair after cell exposition to methylnitronitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and H2O2. Our findings suggest Viburnum opulus fruit as a dietary source of phytocompounds, which could be considered as a tailored design food supplement components for the prevention and treatment of postprandial elevation of glucose and fatty acids through delaying the rate of glucose and fatty acid absorption by intestinal cells.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tecoma stans is traditionally used by several ethnical groups in Mexico and Central America to treat diabetes. This species is mentioned in the majority of the ethnopharmacological studies compiled in Mexico focused in medicinal plants used as anti-diabetic treatment. Aim of the study: Recently, this plant was found to display a high level of pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity, in addition to the several action mechanisms already described. Here we show the phytochemical and in vitro pharmacological characterization of some of the compounds responsible for the antilipase activity.
   Materials and methods: Starting with a hydroalcoholic extract, fractions were obtained by liquid-liquid separation and successive processes of column chromatography purifications. Lipase inhibitory activity was measured employing a spectrophotometric analysis. For structural elucidation H-1 and C-13 NMR experiments were used. HPLC was used to quantify and confirm the identity of the bioactive compounds.
   Results: Bio-guided chemical purification of the hydroalcoholic extract produced an organic fraction (ethyl acetate, TsEA), flavone fractions (TsC1F13), (TsC1F15), (TsC1F16) and isolated compounds (chrysoeriol, apigenin, luteolin, and verbascoside) with the capability to inhibit the activity of pancreatic lipase. The most active fraction (TsC2F6B) was constituted by a mixture of Chrysoeriol (5,7-dihydroxy-2-[4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl]chromen-4-one, 96%) and Apigenin (4%). This flavone mixture displayed a percentage of inhibition of 85% when it was eavaluated at 0.25 mg/mL. Luteolin and chrysoeriol produced a noncompetitive and mixed inhibition with values of IC50 = 63 and 158 mu M respectively. The content of chrysoeriol was also quantified in the hydroalcoholic extract (TsHAE) and organic fraction (TsEA) as 1% and 7% respectively. All of this confirms that high proportion of both flavones produce an increase of the biological activity due to they show the highest inhibition of lipase enzyme in a concentration dependant way.
   Conclusions: These results evidence that the medicinal use of T. stans could be in part because of its lipase inhibitory activity allowing to adapt the administration of this plant before meals. Also this data could help to develop a novel phytopharmaceutical drug (standardized in luteolin, chrysoeriol, and apigenin) auxiliary for the Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objective: To assess the relationship between socioeconomic and anthropometric data, frequency of food consumption, and the development of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in patients from a small rural town in northeastern Brazil.
   Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire study was performed on patients from the Lagarto City Hospital (n = 50) and from family health units (n = 370).
   Results: The 420patients in the study had one or more NCDs such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. The mean age was 63.1 +/- 8.7years for both sexes. The typical patient was of mixed or black descent (66%), a farmer, and of low socioeconomic status and education; 100% of men and 84% of women were illiterate or had less than 4years of schooling. Approximately 50% of women and 89% of men were married and most had never used tobacco or were ex-smokers. The body mass index (BMI) of the study population was 29.4 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2), where 70% of the patients were type 2 diabetic with waist circumferences of 99.8 +/- 21.2 cm for men and 98.1 +/- 13.9 cm for women. The correlation between BMI and waist circumference was r = 0.88. Even with the use of medication, total cholesterol levels of above 240mg/dL were recorded in 10% of women and about 5% of men. Likewise, 10% of women and 100% of men had triglyceride levels above 200mg/dL; glucose levels were 133.6 +/- 47.4mg/dL in men and 110.8 +/- 38.8mg/dL in women. Blood pressure values were high, even in patients using one or more antihypertensive drugs for at least 2years (systolic pressure = 128.5 +/- 18.2; diastolic pressure = 86.3 +/- 8.9mmHg). Indices considered above the limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were obtained for 60% of women and 100% of men. Our research revealed that this population is characterized by a relatively low intake of fats and oils. Nevertheless, 100% of patients consumed meat every day, 57.6% never consumed processed foods such as candy or soft drinks, and 89% consumed coffee daily. Furthermore, the consumption of fruits was very low: 46.6% of respondents never ate fruit and 7.8% rarely consumed fruit. Likewise, 68.2% reported never eating milk and dairy products. Vegetables were consumed by only 51.4% of the population and 38.5% rarely or never consumed green vegetables. Products made from wheat, maize, cassava, beans, and rice were often consumed by 59.2% of the population.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the studied population is affected by nutritional transition, in which the greater access to carbohydrates and animal proteins is associated with high BMI, with the vast majority overweight and suffering from uncontrolled hypertension despite the use of medications. The high consumption of carbohydrates and animal protein, rapid urbanization, and sedentary lifestyle are the main factors responsible for the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases, especially among people with low income and education. Men are particularly affected, with increased visceral fat characterized by an increased waist circumference.

AB Background: Thermogenic (TRM) supplements are often used by people seeking to decrease body weight. Many TRM supplements are formulated with multiple ingredients purported to increase energy expenditure and maximize fat loss. However, in the past some TRM ingredients have been deemed unsafe and removed from the market. Therefore, it is important to verify the safety of multi-ingredient TRM supplements with chronic consumption.
   Objective: To assess the safety of daily consumption of a multi-ingredient TRM supplement over a 28-day period in healthy adults.
   Design: Twenty-three recreationally active adults (11M, 12F; 27.1 +/- 5.4 years, 171.6 +/- 9.6 cm, 76.8 +/- 16.1 kg, 26 +/- 5 BMI) were randomly assigned either to consume a multi-ingredient TRM supplement (SUP; n = 9) or remain unsupplemented (CRL; n = 14) for 28 days. Participants maintained their habitual dietary and exercise routines for the duration of the study. Fasting blood samples, resting blood pressure, and heart rate were taken before and after the supplementation period. Samples were analyzed for complete blood counts, comprehensive metabolic, and lipid panels.
   Results: Significant (p<0.05) group by time interactions were present for diastolic BP, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), chloride, CO2, globulin, albumin: globulin (A/G), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Dependent t-tests conducted on significant variables revealed significant (p<0.05) within-group differences in SUP for diastolic BP (+6.2 +/- 5.3 mmHG), creatinine (+0.09 +/- 0.05 mg/dL), eGFR (-11.2 +/- 5.8 mL/min/1.73), globulin (-0.29 +/- 0.24 g/dL), A/G (+0.27 +/- 0.23), and HDL (-5.0 +/- 5.5 mg/dL), and in CRL for CO2 (-1.9 +/- 1.5 mmol/L) between time points. Each variable remained within the accepted physiological range.
   Conclusion: Results of the present study support the clinical safety of a multi-ingredient TRM containing caffeine, green tea extract, and cayenne powder. Although there were statistically significant (p<0.05) intragroup differences in SUP from pre-to postsupplementation for diastolic BP, creatinine, eGFR, globulin, A/G, and HDL, all remained within accepted physiological ranges and were not clinically significant. In sum, it appears as though daily supplementation with a multi-ingredient TRM is safe for consumption by healthy adults for a 28-day period.

AB Background Higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, and the prevalence of obesity varies by geographic region. Although information on whether SSB intake differs geographically could be valuable for designing targeted interventions, this information is limited.
   Objective This cross-sectional study examined associations between living in specific census regions and frequency of SSB consumption among US adults using 2010 National Health Interview Survey data (n=25,431).
   Methods SSB consumption was defined as the consumption of four types of beverages (regular sugar-sweetened carbonated beverages, fruit drinks, sports/energy drinks, and sweetened coffee/tea drinks). The exposure variable was census region of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs for drinking SSBs after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results Approximately 64% of adults consumed SSBs >= 1 time/day. The odds of drinking SSBs >= 1 time/day were significantly higher among adults living in the Northeast (aOR=1.13; 95% CI=1.01, 1.26) but lower among adults living in the Midwest (aOR=0.70; 95% CI=0.64, 0.78) or West (aOR=0.78; 95% CI=0.71, 0.87) compared with those living in the South. By type of SSB, the odds of drinking regular soda >= 1 time/day was significantly lower among adults living in the Northeast (aOR=0.51; 95% CI=0.45, 0.57), Midwest (aOR=0.86; 95% CI=0.78, 0.96), or West (aOR=0.56; 95% CI=0.51, 0.62) than those living in the South. The odds of drinking sports/energy drinks >= 1 time/day were significantly lower among adults living in the West (aOR=0.77; 95% CI=0.64, 0.93) than those living in the South. The odds of drinking a sweetened coffee/tea drink >= 1 time/day were significantly higher among adults living in the Northeast (aOR=1.60; 95% CI=1.43, 1.78) but lower among adults living in the Midwest (aOR=0.70; 95% CI=0.62, 0.78) than those living in the South.
   Conclusions Total frequency of SSB consumption and types of SSB consumption differed by geographic region. Interventions to reduce SSB intake could consider regional variations in SSB intake, particularly when more local data are not available.

AB The main purpose of this study was to investigate the hepatotoxic potential and effects on the gut microbiome of decaffeinated green tea extract (dGTE) in lean B6C3F(1) mice. Gavaging dGTE over a range of 1X-10X mouse equivalent doses (MED) for up to two weeks did not elicit significant histomorphological, physiological, biochemical or molecular alterations in mouse livers. At the same time, administration of dGTE at MED comparable to those consumed by humans resulted in significant modulation of gut microflora, with increases in Akkermansia sp. being most pronounced. Results of this study demonstrate that administration of relevant-to-human-consumption MED of dGTE to non-fasting mice does not lead to hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, dGTE administered to lean mice, caused changes in gut microflora comparable to those observed in obese mice. This study provides further insight into the previously reported weight management properties of dGTE; however, future studies are needed to fully evaluate and understand this effect.

AB Obesity as part of metabolic syndrome is a major lifestyle disorder throughout the world. Current drug treatments for obesity produce small and usually unsustainable decreases in body weight with the risk of major adverse effects. Surgery has been the only treatment producing successful long-term weight loss. As a different but complementary approach, lifestyle modification including the use of functional foods could produce a reliable decrease in obesity with decreased comorbidities. Functional foods may include fruits such as berries, vegetables, fibre-enriched grains and beverages such as tea and coffee. Although health improvements continue to be reported for these functional foods in rodent studies, further evidence showing the translation of these results into humans is required. Thus, the concept that these fruits and vegetables will act as functional foods in humans to reduce obesity and thereby improve health remains intuitive and possible rather than proven.

AB We assessed purchases made, motivations for shopping, and frequency of shopping at four New York City corner stores (bodegas). Surveys and purchase inventories (n = 779) were collected from consumers at four bodegas in Bronx, NY. We use Chi square tests to compare types of consumers, items purchased and characteristics of purchases based on how frequently the consumer shops at the specific store and the time of day the purchase was made. Most consumers shopped at the bodega because it was close to their home (52 %). The majority (68 %) reported shopping at the bodega at least once per day. The five most commonly purchased items were sugary beverages, (29.27 %), sugary snacks (22.34 %), coffee, (13.99 %), sandwiches, (13.09 %) and non-baked potato chips (12.2 %). Nearly 60 % of bodega customers reported their purchase to be healthy. Most of the participants shopped at the bodega frequently, valued its convenient location, and purchased unhealthy items. Work is needed to discover ways to encourage healthier choices at these stores.

AB Pu-erh tea is produced from the leaves of large-leaf tea species (Camellia sinensis var. assamica) in the Yunnan province of China and divided into ripened pu-erh tea (RIPT, with pile-fermentation) and raw pu-erh tea (RAPT) according to processing methods. RIPT extract showed more potent anti-diabetic effects on two-hour postprandial blood glucose (2h-PBG) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) than RAPT extract. UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS and UHPLC-PDA analyses found that 17 newly formed components and the increased components after fermentation, such as quinic acid, gallic acid, caffeine, puerin I and so on, might be the main contributors to the enhanced activities of RIPT. In addition, the probiotic role of RIPT to some beneficial gut bacteria, such as lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae NK3B31 group, Alloprevotella and Prevotella, was observed in our study. These results might provide a clue to anti-diabetic mechanism and active components of pu-erh tea, and use as a functional beverage worth to be further studied.

AB Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are transcription factors that modulate energy metabolism in liver, adipose tissue and muscle. High fat diets (HFD) can negatively impact PPAR expression or activity, favoring obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and other conditions. However, polyphenols (PP) found in vegetable foodstuffs are capable of positively modulating this pathway. We therefore focused this review on the possible effects that PP can have on PPAR when administered together with HFD. We found that PP from diverse sources, such as coffee, olives, rice, berries and others, are capable of inducing the expression of genes involved in a decrease of adipose mass, liver and serum lipids and lipid biosynthesis in animal and cell models of HFD. Since cells or gut bacteria can transform PP into different metabolites, it is possible that a synergistic or antagonistic effect ultimately occurs. PP molecules from vegetable sources are an interesting option to maintain or return to a state of energy homeostasis, possibly due to an adequate PPAR expression and activity.

AB This review aims to make an outline of the existing clinical studies from the past twenty years concerning to mate effects in human health. Physiological effects have been attributed to phenolics, methylxanthines and saponins. Antilipemic activity was more consistent than glycaemic control. Mate seems to protect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) from oxidation in whole plasma. Results from isolated LDL-c particles are contradictory. The antioxidant enzymatic complex was positively modulated, indicating that mate might help in the redox homeostasis maintenance. Most clinical trials did not find a significant positive effect of mate consumption on glycaemia. However, it seems that mate hypoglycaemic effect is more evident in type-2 diabetes mellitus subjects. Mate had no effect on anti-glycation in vivo. It has shown potential to increase energy expenditure and weight loss. Carcinogenicity is related to consumption temperature, not mate itself. Long-term randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies are essential to provide more consistent data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Green tea extract activates AMPK and ameliorates white adipose tissue

AB Beneficial effects of green tea (GT) polyphenols against obesity have been reported. However, until this moment the molecular mechanisms of how green tea can modulate obesity and regulates fat metabolism, particularly in adipose tissue, remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of GT extract in the adipose tissue of obese animals and its effect on weight gain, metabolism and function (de novo lipogenesis and lipolysis), and the involvement of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
   Male Wistar rats were treated with GT by gavage (12 weeks/5 days/week; 500 mg/kg of body weight), and obesity was induced by cafeteria diet (8 weeks). Here, we show that obese rats treated with GT showed a significant reduction in indicators of obesity such as hyperlipidemia, fat synthesis, body weight, and fat depots as compared to those treated with standard control diet. AMPK was induced in adipose tissue in rats that were treated with GT and likely restored insulin sensitivity, increased mRNA expression of GLUT4, reducing the concentrations of plasma and liver lipid content, also stimulating fatty acid oxidation in the same tissue. Importantly, repression of de novo lipogenesis in the adipose tissue, reduced lipid droplets in the liver, and the development of insulin resistance in diet-induced obese rats were accompanied by AMPK activation.
   Our study identified that metabolic changes caused by GT intake induced AMPK activation and modulate the expression of genes involved in metabolism, particularly in adipose tissue, thus offering a therapeutic strategy to combat insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and obesity in rats.

AB This research examines the larger-scale associations between obesity and food environments in metropolitan areas in the United States (US). The US Census County Business Patterns dataset for 2011 was used to construct various indices of food environments for selected metropolitan areas. The numbers of employees engaged in supermarkets, convenience stores, full service restaurants, fast food restaurants, and snack/coffee shops were standardised using the location quotients, and factor analysis was used to produce two uncorrelated factors measuring food environments. Data on obesity were obtained from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Individual level obesity measures were linked to the metropolitan area level food environment factors. Models were fitted using generalised estimating equations to control for metropolitan area level intra-correlation and individual level sociodemographic characteristics. It was found that adults residing in cities with a large share of supermarket and full-service restaurant workers were less likely to be obese, while adults residing in cities with a large share of convenience store and fast food restaurant workers were more likely to be obese. Supermarkets and full-service restaurant workers are concentrated in the Northeast and West of the US, where obesity prevalence is relatively lower, while convenience stores and fast-food restaurant workers are concentrated in the South and Midwest, where obesity prevalence is relatively higher. The food environment landscapes measured at the metropolitan area level explain the continental-scale patterns of obesity prevalence. The types of food that are readily available and widely served may translate into obesity disparities across metropolitan areas.

AB Background Among adults and children consuming Western diets, beverages are significant sources of free sugars, saturated fats, excess calories, and alcohol, with relevance to chronic disease risk. The impact of recent healthy eating policies and beverage market evolutions on population-level consumption patterns in Canada is unknown. The current study examined trends in intake of a range of beverage types among a nationally-representative sample of Canadians, with stratification by socio-demographic characteristics. Methods The 2004 (n = 34,775) and 2015 (n = 20,176) nutrition-focused cycles of the Canadian Community Health Surveys are cross-sectional surveys representative of the population of the 10 Canadian provinces. Based on a single multiple-pass 24-h dietary recall for each participant, fluids consumed as beverages were grouped into seven categories. Using linear regression, reported intake (volume, ml and energy, kcal) of each category was characterized over time and in relation to sex, age, ethnicity, income, body mass index (BMI), and province of residence. Results In 2015, Canadians reported consuming an average of 1806 ml (275 kcal) fluids as beverages per day, including: plain water 867 ml (0 kcal); other unsweetened beverages, e.g. coffee, 364 ml (6 kcal); sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) 204 ml (99 kcal); plain milk 132 ml (64 kcal); alcoholic drinks 120 ml (71 kcal); 100% juice 74 ml (34 kcal); and diet or low calorie beverages 44 ml (2 kcal). Differential consumption was observed across socio-demographic groups, with high consumption of sugary drinks (i.e., SSBs and 100% juice) and alcohol across groups. From 2004 to 2015, the reported volumes of beverages consumed decreased by 10% (energy: - 24%). With adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics, there were significant changes (p < 0.001) over time in intake of: 100% juice - 40% (- 38%); plain milk - 37% (- 35%); SSBs - 26% (- 20%); diet or low calorie beverages (- 46%); and other unsweetened beverages - 11% (- 42%). The volume of plain water consumed increased by 10% (p < 0.0001). Intake of alcoholic (volume and energy) and diet or light beverages did not change significantly. Conclusions Lower intake of beverages was reported by Canadians in 2015 versus 2004, with a shift towards plain water. Consumption of sugary drinks decreased, but these beverages continue to contribute substantially to Canadians' overall energy intake. The findings underscore the need for policies to further reduce the consumption of sugary and alcoholic beverages, as well as calories from beverages.

AB Health educators are increasingly publicizing the noxious health effects of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB). American counties are implementing SSB taxes, as modeled after the 'success' of tobacco policies, to address the 'obesity crisis'. Under-explored is how the linking of SSB to a stigmatized condition, 'obesity', has affected attitudes toward the purchasing and consumption of SSB and those individuals who purchase and consume SSB. This study sought to explore individuals' attitudes and experiences with SSB in rural Michigan. Three themes emerged: Negativity, Egregious beverages and Implicated imbibers. These attitudes were situated within a context of increased exposure to SSB health discourses, particularly among younger participants. Additional themes arose regarding which SSB were labelled especially problematic, who should or should not be drinking SSB, as well as the consequences of drinking SSB. Pop/soda, energy drinks, and diet pop/soda were identified as particularly harmful, albeit for different reasons - sugar, caffeine, and unnatural additives. Many participants reported reacting negatively when they saw children of higher weights drinking SSB, though judgement was reserved for parents. Ultimately, SSB and their consumers appear increasingly stigmatized in ways that carry important equity implications for already marginalized groups.

AB Purpose: To assess the consumer food environment in restaurants in Saskatoon, using the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey for Restaurants (NEMS-R), to examine differences by neighbourhood distress level and to reflect on the need for further refinement of the assessment of restaurant consumer food environments.
   Methods: Neighbourhoods were classified as low, middle, or high distress level based on the socioeconomic indicators (income, employment, and education) in the Material Deprivation Index. Differences in restaurant consumer food environments, indicated by mean NEMS-R total and sub-scores, were examined by various restaurant categories and by varying neighbourhood distress levels.
   Results: Chain coffee shops and pita and sandwich restaurants had higher NEMS-R totals and "Healthy Entrees" sub-scores; however, burger and chicken restaurants and pizza restaurants had more barriers to healthful eating. Although restaurants in lower distress level neighbourhoods generally rated healthier (higher NEMS-R scores), only a few measures (such as "Facilitators" and "Barriers") significantly differed by neighbourhood distress level.
   Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of developing interventions to improve restaurant consumer food environments, especially in neighbourhoods with higher distress levels. The results suggest that reliable measures of the consumer food environment could be developed beginning with what can be measured by NEMS-R.

AB The treatment of obese patients is a topic investigated by an increasing number of researchers. This study aimed to elucidate the possible inhibitory effect of tangeritin on the development and function of fat cells. 3T3-L1 fat cells were grown to confluence and subjected to different concentrations of tangeritin. The most effective tangeritin inhibition concentration was determined by the MTT assay. The treated cells were subjected to real-time reverse transcriptase FOR and western blot analysis, to detect changes in the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)a, C/EBPI3, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) y expression levels. The MTT assay revealed that the fat cell growth was inhibited at a 20 ng/mL concentration of tangeritin. The results of realtime FOR revealed a significant decrease in the expression of C/EBP alpha, C/ EBP beta, and PPAR gamma mRNA, following the treatment with tangeritin. Western blot analysis also presented similar results at a protein level. Therefore, we concluded that tangeritin inhibits adipogenesis via the down-regulation of C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and PPAR gamma mRNA and protein expression in 3T3-L1 cells.

AB We aimed to assess the associations of socioeconomic factors with dietary patterns in a Guatemalan population.
   Cross-sectional data of 1076 participants (42 % men, mean age 32.6 +/- A 4.2 years) collected between 2002 and 2004 in four rural villages in Guatemala. Dietary patterns were derived using principal component analysis. Chi-square and Poisson regression models were used to assess associations between socioeconomic factors and dietary patterns.
   Three dietary patterns were identified: "Western" (high in processed foods), "traditional" (high in traditional foods) and "coffee and sugar", explaining 11, 7 and 6 % of the variance, respectively. Annual expenditures were associated with a higher adherence to the "Western" pattern: prevalence ratios [(PR) (95 % confidence interval)] 1.92 (1.17-3.15) for the highest vs. lowest expenditure group in men and 8.99 (3.57-22.64) in women. A borderline significant (p = 0.06) negative association was found between the "traditional" pattern and higher household expenditures [0.71 (0.49-1.02) in men] and with schooling [0.23 (0.05-1.02)] in women (p = 0.05).
   Dietary patterns in Guatemala are predicted by socioeconomic factors. In particular, high annual expenditures are associated with a more westernized, less traditional diet.

AB This study assessed personal and environmental correlates of Belgian university students' soft and energy drink consumption and investigated whether these associations were moderated by gender or residency. Four hundred twenty-five university students completed a self-reported on-line questionnaire assessing socio-demographics, health status, soft and energy drink consumption, as well as personal and environmental factors related to soft and energy drink consumption. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Students believing soft drink intake should be minimized (individual subjective norm), finding it less difficult to avoid soft drinks (perceived behavioral control), being convinced they could avoid soft drinks in different situations (self-efficacy), having family and friends who rarely consume soft drinks (modelling), and having stricter family rules about soft drink intake were less likely to consume soft drinks. Students showing stronger behavioral control, having stricter family rules about energy drink intake, and reporting lower energy drink availability were less likely to consume energy drinks. Gender and residency moderated several associations between psychosocial constructs and consumption. Future research should investigate whether interventions focusing on the above personal and environmental correlates can indeed improve university students' beverage choices.

   PROFILE
AB Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a set of cardiovascular risk factors which severely increases the risk of type II diabetes, renal disease and cardiovascular disease. Over the last decades, the role of dietary bioactive substances in features of MetS has been extensively investigated. Due to their multiple properties, these plant-derived natural compounds have demonstrated to provide positive effects in obesity, diabetes, renal and in cardiovascular disease. Catechins of green tea and caffeine reduce body mass index and waist circumference. Catechins, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins of cocoa reduce blood pressure and blood glucose. Curcumin and silymarin exert hepatoprotective effects. Monacolins of red yeast rice are effective cholesterol-lowering agents. However, inconsistent or conflicting results have been found in clinical trials when other promising compounds in vitro or in animal studies, such as policosanol, curcumin or silymarin, were used. Low oral bioavailability of substances, ineffective dosages, inadequate treatment duration and insufficient statistical approach may explain the lack of effectiveness observed in some human studies. Further clinical studies are needed to better understand the role of bioactive compounds in the prevention and management of MetS.

AB Obesity is characterized by hypertrophy and/or by the differentiation or adipogenesis of pre-existing adipocytes. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of theobromine, a type of alkaloid in cocoa, on adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and its mechanisms of action. Theobromine inhibited the accumulation of lipid droplets, the expression of PPAR gamma and C/EBP alpha, and the mRNA expression of aP2 and leptin. The inhibition of adipogenic differentiation by theobromine occurred primarily in the early stages of differentiation. In addition, theobromine arrested the cell cycle at the G(0)/G(1) phase and regulated the expressions of CDK2, p27, and p21. Theobromine treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation and knockdown of AMPK alpha 1/alpha 2 prevented the ability of theobromine to inhibit PPAR. expression in the differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. Theobromine reduced the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK. Moreover, the secretion and the mRNA level of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were inhibited by theobromine treatment. These data suggest that theobromine inhibits adipocyte differentiation during the early stages of adipogenesis by regulating the expression of PPAR. and C/EBP alpha through the AMPK and ERK/JNK signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.

AB During the past decades, phytochemical terpenoids, polyphenols, lignans, flavonoids, and alkaloids have been identified as antioxidative and cytoprotective agents. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a kinase that controls redox-state and oxidative stress in the cell, and serves as a key molecule regulating energy metabolism. Many phytochemicals directly or indirectly alter the AMPK pathway in distinct manners, exerting catabolic metabolism. Some of them are considered promising in the treatment of metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. Another important kinase that regulates energy metabolism is Fyn kinase, a member of the Src family kinases that plays a role in various cellular responses such as insulin signaling, cell growth, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Phytochemical inhibition of Fyn leads to AMPK-mediated protection of the cell in association with increased antioxidative capacity and mitochondrial biogenesis. The kinases may work together to form a signaling circuitry for the homeostasis of energy conservation and expenditure, and may serve as targets of phytochemicals. This review is intended as a compilation of recent advancements in the pharmacological research of phytochemicals targeting Fyn and AMPK circuitry, providing information for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases and the accompanying tissue injuries.

AB The objective was to investigate the relationships between body mass index (BMI), skipping breakfast, and breakfast patterns in Brazilian adults. We analyzed data of 21,003 individuals aged between 20 to 59 from the Brazilian National Dietary Survey 2008-2009. Breakfast was defined as the eating occasion between 5 and 10a.m. with the highest usual food consumption (exceeding 50Kcal/209.2kJ). Dietary patterns were derived by the factor analysis of 18 food groups (usual intake). Controlling for confounders linear regressions of BMI were used to verify the associations considering the survey design. Skipping breakfast was not associated with BMI. Three breakfast patterns were observed (48% variability): Brazilian Northern (positive loading for meats, preparations with corn, eggs, tubers/roots/potatoes, dairy products, savory snacks/crackers, fruit juices/fruit drinks/soy-based drinks); Western (positive for fruit juices/fruit drinks/soy-based drinks, sandwiches/ pizza, baked/deep-fried snacks, chocolate/desserts, cakes/cookies) and Brazilian Southeastern (cold cut meat, milk, cheese, coffee/tea, bread). The Brazilian Southeastern pattern was inversely associated with BMI, while the Brazilian Northern pattern was directly associated with it. Therefore, the results suggest a role for breakfast quality in the association with BMI. Thus, a Brazilian Southeastern breakfast usual intake may be inversely associated with BMI.

AB Tea, a popular beverage made from leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis, has been shown to reduce body weight, alleviate metabolic syndrome, and prevent diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in animal models and humans. Such beneficial effects have generally been observed in most human studies when the level of tea consumption was three to four cups (600-900 mg tea catechins) or more per day. Green tea is more effective than black tea. In spite of numerous studies, the fundamental mechanisms for these actions still remain unclear. From a review of the literature, we propose that the two major mechanisms are: (i) decreasing absorption of lipids and proteins by tea constituents in the intestine, thus reducing calorie intake; and (ii) activating AMP-activated protein kinase by tea polyphenols that are bioavailable in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues. The relative importance of these two mechanisms depends on the types of tea and diet consumed by individuals. The activated AMP-activated protein kinase would decrease gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis and increase catabolism, leading to body weight reduction and metabolic syndrome alleviation. Other mechanisms and the health relevance of these beneficial effects of tea consumption remain to be further investigated.

AB Obesity affects the major metabolic and cellular processes involved in skeletal muscle contractility. Surprisingly, the effect of obesity on isolated skeletal muscle performance remains unresolved. The present study is the first to examine the muscle-specific changes in contractility following dietary-induced obesity using an isolated muscle work-loop (WL) model that more closely represents in vivo muscle performance. Following 16-wk high-calorific feeding, soleus (SOL), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and diaphragm (DIA) were isolated from female (CD-1) mice, and contractile performance was compared against a lean control group. Obese SOL produced greater isometric force; however, isometric stress (force per unit muscle area), absolute WL power, and normalized WL power (watts per kilogram muscle mass) were unaffected. Maximal isometric force and absolute WL power of the EDL were similar between groups. For both EDL and DIA, isometric stress and normalized WL power were reduced in the obese groups. Obesity caused a significant reduction in fatigue resistance in all cases. Our findings demonstrate a muscle-specific reduction in contractile performance and muscle quality that is likely related to in vivo mechanical role, fiber type, and metabolic profile, which may in part be related to changes in myosin heavy chain expression and AMP-activated protein kinase activity. These results infer that, beyond the additional requirement of moving a larger body mass, functional performance and quality of life may be further limited by poor muscle function in obese individuals. As such, a reduction in muscle performance may be a substantial contributor to the negative cycle of obesity.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The effect of obesity on isolated muscle function is surprisingly underresearched. The present study is the first to examine the effects of obesity on isolated muscle performance using a method that more closely represents real-world muscle function. This work uniquely establishes a muscle-specific profile of mechanical changes in relation to underpinning mechanisms. These findings may be important to understanding the negative cycle of obesity and in designing interventions for improving weight status.

AB High intake of added sugars is associated with excess energy intake and poorer diet quality. The objective of this cross-sectional study (n = 16,806) was to estimate usual intakes and the primary food sources of added sugars across the range of intakes (i.e., deciles) among U.S. children (2-8 years), adolescents and teens (9-18 years), and adults (19 years) using the National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES) data from 2009-2012. The percent energy contributed by added sugars was 14.3 +/- 0.2% (2-8 years), 16.2 +/- 0.2% (9-18 years), and 13.1 +/- 0.2% (19 years), suggesting the highest intakes are among adolescents and teens. However, the primary foods/beverages that contribute to added sugars were remarkably consistent across the range of intakes, with the exception of the lowest decile, and include sweetened beverages and sweet bakery products. Interestingly across all age groups, even those in the lowest decile of added sugars exceed the 10% guidelines. Additional foods contributing to high intakes were candy and other desserts (e.g., ice cream) in children and adolescents, and coffee and teas in adults. Tailoring public health messaging to reduce intakes of these identified food groups may be of utility in designing effective strategies to reduce added sugar intake in the U.S.

AB Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is a plant originated in Brazil that presents a beneficial effect on body weight control and metabolic alterations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of guarana on genes and miRNAs related to adipogenesis in 3T3L1 cells. The anti-adipogenic effect of guarana was evaluated by Oil Red-O staining. Gene and miRNA expression levels were determined by real time PCR. The Cebp alpha and beta-catenin nuclear translocation were evaluated using immunocytochemistry. Our data indicated that the triglyceride-reducing effect of guarana was dose-dependent from 100 to 300 mu g/mL (-12%, -20%, -24% and -40%, respectively, p < 0.0001). An up-regulation of the anti-adipogenic genes Wnt10b, Wnt3a, Wnt1, Gata3 and Dlk1 and a down-regulation of pro-adipogenic genes Cebp alpha, Ppar gamma and Creb1 were also observed. Furthermore, guarana repressed mmu-miR-27b-3p, mmu-miR-34b-5p and mmu-miR-760-5p, that contributed for up-regulation of their molecular targets Wnt3a, Wnt1 and Wnt10b. Additionally, cells treated with guarana presented an increase on beta-catenin nuclear translocation (p < 0.0018). In summary, our data indicate that guarana has an anti-adipogenic potential due to its ability to modulate miRNAs and genes related to this process. Together our data demonstrate the important role of guarana as a putative therapeutic agent.

AB Many prevalent and costly health disorders in the U.S. can be attributed in part to poor diets, overconsumption of calories, and physical inactivity. Taxing less healthy foods and subsidizing healthy foods as a strategy to improve diet and health has attracted growing interest among policy makers and researchers. We test this strategy by using national household purchase data to estimate a censored, price and expenditure endogenous demand system for 12 food groups that are commonly consumed at breakfast: low- and high-nutrition ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, eggs, breads, hot cereals, breakfast bars, juice, whole and reduced-fat milk, yogurt, meats, and coffee. The estimated demand elasticities are applied to nationally representative food intake data to simulate under the assumption of perfectly price elastic supply the potential dietary improvement from taxing low-nutrition and subsidizing high nutrition ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. We find that the demand for both types of cereals is own price inelastic, suggesting that consumers are not likely to make large shifts in consumption of cereals if the price changes. Thus only limited dietary improvement can be expected from taxes and subsidies. Furthermore, when the healthfulness of breakfast foods is evaluated using a comprehensive list of nutrients and food components, a price intervention strategy may result in unintended, adverse impacts. Our simulation results suggest that the hypothetical price intervention actually increases the calorie content of foods consumed at breakfast. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Chile has the highest sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) sales of any country and a growing burden of childhood obesity. This study examines SSB intake in Chilean children after a 5% SSB tax increase in 2014 but prior to marketing, labeling, and school policies implemented in 2016. Methods: 24-h recalls were collected in 2016 from two cohorts comprised of preschoolers 3-5 years of age (n = 961) and adolescents 12-14 years of age (n = 770) from low-moderate income neighborhoods. Beverages were categorized as regulated or unregulated according to whether they exceeded nutrient thresholds established by the 2016 policies. Results: Preschoolers consumed mainly beverage calories from regulated dairy beverages and substitutes (109 kcal, SD 30), unregulated dairy beverages (102 kcal, SD 24), and regulated fruit and vegetables drinks (44 kcal, SD 20). For adolescents, the greatest contributions came from regulated sodas (77 kcal, SD 47), regulated dairy beverages and substitutes (41 kcal, SD 16), and unregulated coffee and tea (41 kcal, SD 11). Overall, regulated beverages provided a greater proportion of calories than unregulated for preschoolers (15.0% vs. 11.8%) and for adolescents (9.1% vs. 5.0%). Conclusions: Before major policy implementation, regulated beverages accounted for a higher percentage of energy intake than unregulated beverages among both age groups. Future research will be needed to evaluate the impact of Chile's new policies on sugary beverage intake in children.

AB Objectives: The aim of the study was to understand determinants of ageing in relation to future cardiovascular disease (CVD) events at population level, and to explore determinants of healthy ageing and its relation to 10-year CVD incidence among apparently healthy individuals.
   Methods: In the context of the ATTICA study 453 apparently healthy men (45 +/- 13 years) and 400 women (44 +/- 18 years) with complete psychological evaluation were studied and followed during 2002-2012. Healthy Ageing Index (HAI) (range 0-7) was calculated based on socioeconomical, bio-clinical, psychological, and lifestyle characteristics (i.e. dietary habits and physical activity) of the participants during the baseline examination. CVD incidence during the follow-up period was defined according to ICD-10 criteria.
   Results: Healthy Ageing Index was inversely associated with higher 10-year CVD risk (OR per 1/7 (95% CI): 0.47 (0.28, 0.80). Age and sex-adjusted determinants of healthy ageing were abnormal waist to hip ratio (p <0.001), increased coffee consumption (p = 0.04), reduced basic metabolic rhythm (p <0.001), increased triglycerides (p = 0.003), and C-reactive protein levels (p = 0.02), as aggravating factors, while moderate alcohol consumption (p =0.002) was identified as a positive influential parameter.
   Conclusions: Understanding healthy ageing, as a dominant factor of CVD development, provides a new direction for better prevention efforts focused on healthy ageing at both population and individual level.

AB The term 'added sugars' refers to sugars and syrup added to foods during processing or preparation, and sugars and syrups added at the table. Calls to limit the daily intakes of added sugars and its sources arose from evidence analysed by WHO, the American Heart Association and other organizations. The present review examined the best available evidence regarding levels of added sugar consumption among different age and sex groups in Malaysia and sources of added sugars. Information was extracted from food balance sheets, household expenditure surveys, nutrition surveys and published studies. Varying results emerged, as nationwide information on intake of sugar and foods with added sugar were obtained at different times and used different assessment methods. Data from the 2003 Malaysian Adult Nutrition Survey (MANS) using food frequency questionnaires suggested that on average, Malaysian adults consumed 30 grams of sweetened condensed milk (equivalent to 16 grams sugar) and 21 grams of table sugar per day, which together are below the WHO recommendation of 50 grams sugar for every 2000 kcal/day to reduce risk of chronic disease. Published studies suggested that, for both adults and the elderly, frequently consumed sweetened foods were beverages (tea or coffee) with sweetened condensed milk and added sugar. More accurate data should be obtained by conducting population-wide studies using biomarkers of sugar intake (e.g. 24-hour urinary sucrose and fructose excretion or serum abundance of the stable isotope C-13) to determine intake levels, and multiple 24 hour recalls to identify major food sources of added sugar.

AB Objective: The current study sought to examine Guatemalan adolescents' consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), identify which individuallevel characteristics are associated with SSB consumption and describe school characteristics that may influence students' SSB consumption.
   Design: Within this observational pilot study, a questionnaire was used to assess students' consumption of three varieties of SSB (soft drinks, energy drinks, sweetened coffees/teas), as well as a variety of sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics. We collected built environment data to examine aspects of the school food environment. We developed Poisson regression models for each SSB variety and used descriptive analyses to characterize the sample.
   Setting: Guatemala City, Guatemala.
   Subjects: Guatemalan adolescents (n 1042) from four (two public, two private) secondary schools.
   Results: Built environment data revealed that students from the two public schools lacked access to water fountains/coolers. The SSB industry had a presence in the schools through advertisements, sponsored food kiosks and products available for sale. Common correlates of SSB consumption included school type, sedentary behaviour, frequency of purchasing lunch in the cafeteria, and frequency of purchasing snacks from vending machines in school and off school property.
   Conclusions: Guatemalan adolescents frequently consume SSB, which may be encouraged by aspects of the school environment. Schools represent a viable setting for equitable population health interventions designed to reduce SSB consumption, including increasing access to clean drinking-water, reducing access to SSB, restricting SSB marketing and greater enforcement of existing food policies.

AB Objective To systematically review prospective cohort studies about the association between dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence, and to quantify the effects using a meta-analysis.
   Design Databases such as PubMed, ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS and Google Scholar were searched up to 15 January 2015. Cohort studies which tried to examine the association between empirically derived dietary patterns and incident T2DM were selected. The relative risks (RR) and their 95 % confidence intervals for diabetes among participants with highest v. lowest adherence to derived dietary patterns were incorporated into meta-analysis using random-effects models.
   Results Ten studies (n 404 528) were enrolled in the systematic review and meta-analysis; our analysis revealed that adherence to the healthy' dietary patterns significantly reduced the risk of T2DM (RR=086; 95 % CI 082, 090), while the unhealthy' dietary patterns adversely affected diabetes risk (RR=130; 95 % CI 118, 143). Subgroup analysis showed that unhealthy dietary patterns in which foods with high phytochemical content were also loaded did not significantly increase T2DM risk (RR=106; 95 % CI 087, 130).
   Conclusions Healthy' dietary patterns containing vegetables, fruits and whole grains can lower diabetes risk by 14 %. Consuming higher amounts of red and processed meats, high-fat dairy and refined grains in the context of unhealthy' dietary patterns will increase diabetes risk by 30 %; while including foods with high phytochemical content in these patterns can modify this effect.

AB Objective: To investigate the role of dietary intake in the development of premature acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a hospital-based Pakistani population in Karachi.
   Methods: In a case control study, 203 consecutive patients (146 males and 57 females) with their first AMI and age below 45 years were enrolled with informed consent. Similarly, 205 gender and age matched (within 3 years) healthy adults were also included as controls. Dietary intake of both cases and controls was assessed by using a simple 14-item food frequency questionnaire. Using factor analysis, 3 major dietary patterns- prudent dietary pattern, combination dietary pattern and western dietary pattern were identified. Fasting plasma/serum of both cases and controls were analyzed for homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12, blood Pb, ferritin, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. ANOVA and conditional logistic regression were used to predict the association of dietary patterns with AMI.
   Results: Consumption of prudent diet, characterized by high consumption of legumes, vegetables, wheat, chicken and fruits, is protective against the risk of premature AMI. Moderate to high consumption of combination diet, characterized by high intake of eggs, fish, fruits, juices and coffee was associated with decreased risk of AMI. No association was observed between western diet, characterized by high intake of meat, fish and tea with milk and risk of AMI.
   Conclusions: Consumption of a prudent dietary pattern and a combination dietary pattern is protective against the risk of AMI in a Pakistani population.

AB We compared the effects of purified meat proteins on postprandial thermogenesis and on the secretion of and responsiveness to thyroid hormones (THs) in rats. Body temperatures at 2 h after feeding were significantly higher in the chicken and mutton protein groups than in the other groups, and these proteins seem to have a strong thermogenic effect. There were no significant differences in plasma TH concentrations among the groups, but levels of TH-responsive Spot 14 protein in the liver and brown adipose tissue were significantly higher in the chicken and mutton protein groups than in the other groups. Levels of malic enzyme 1 protein in the liver and brown adipose tissue were significantly higher in the chicken protein group than in the other groups except for the mutton protein group. Furthermore, levels of uncoupling protein 1 were higher in the chicken and mutton protein groups than in the other groups. The results suggest that the difference in postprandial thermogenesis of meat is strongly dependent on meat proteins; chicken and mutton proteins are strong promoters of postprandial thermogenesis, and THs may contribute to this effect. Since strong postprandial thermogenesis and high expression levels of TH target genes and their products were not observed in the amino acid group, chicken and mutton proteins or their digested peptides might contribute to these effects.

AB Background: In brain, CREB-regulated transcription co-activator 1 (CRTC1) is involved in metabolic dysregulation. In humans a SNP in CRTC1 was associated to body fat percentage and two SNPs affected RNA Pol II binding and chromatin structure, implying epigenetic regulation of CRTC1. We sought to understand the relevance of CRTC1 SNPs, DNA methylation and expression in human eating behaviour and its relationship to clinical variables of obesity in blood and adipose tissue.
   Methods: 13 CRTC1 SNPs were included to analyze eating behaviour. For rs7256986, follow up association analyses were applied on DNA methylation, CRTC1 expression and clinical parameters. Linear regression was used throughout the study adjusted for age, sex and BMI. Besides data extraction from previous work, rs7256986 was de-novo genotyped and DNA methylation was evaluated by using pyrosequencing.
   Findings: We found several SNPs in the CRTC1 locus nominally associated with human eating behaviour or 2hr postprandial insulin levels and observed a correlation with alcohol and coffee intake (all P< 0.05). G-allele carriers of rs7256986 showed slightly increased hip circumference. We showed that rs7256986 represents a methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) in whole blood and adipose tissue. The presence of the SNP and/or DNA methylation correlated with CRTCI gene expression which in turn, related to BMI and fat distribution.
   Interpretation: Our data support the known role of CRCT1 regulating energy metabolism in brain. Here, we highlight relevance of CRTC1 regulation in blood and adipose tissue. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective To examine food sources among young people in five major Canadian cities.
   Methods As part of the 2016 Canada Food Study, respondents aged 16-30 were recruited from five Canadian cities (Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, Edmonton, and Vancouver) using in-person intercept sampling and completed an online survey (n = 2840 retained for analysis). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize food preparation and purchase locations. A linear regression model was fitted to examine correlates of the proportion of meals that were ready-to-eat or prepared outside the home.
   Results In total, 80% of meals were prepared at home and 20% were prepared outside the home. More than 25% of meals prepared at home were ready-to-eat/box food. Of all meals consumed, 42% were either ready-to-eat/box food prepared at home or prepared outside the home. Food for meals prepared at home was purchased predominantly at grocery stores/supercentres while meals prepared outside the home were purchased predominantly at fast food/quick service/coffee shop outlets. Respondents who were younger, identified as Aboriginal, had obesity, had no children, lived in residence at school, university, or college, and reported poorer cooking skills reported more meals that were ready-to-eat or prepared outside the home.
   Conclusions The current findings indicate that a substantial proportion of meals consumed by young people consist of meals either prepared outside the home or ready-to-eat/box food prepared at home. Dietary recommendations should highlight basic patterns of food preparation and eating, such as limiting ultra-processed food and food prepared outside the home.

AB Objective: To assess potential misperceptions among parents regarding the healthfulness of sugary drinks for their children.
   Design: Online survey of parents. Participants identified the categories and specific brands of sugary drinks they provided for their children. They also indicated their perceptions of sugary drink categories and brands as healthy options for children, perceived importance of on-package claims in purchase decisions and their concerns about common sugary drink ingredients.
   Setting: Online market research panel.
   Subjects: Parents (n 982) of 2- to 17-year-olds, 46 % non-white or Hispanic.
   Results: Ninety-six per cent of parents provided on average 2.9 different categories of sugary drinks for their children in the past month. Flavoured waters, fruit drinks and sports drinks were rated as the healthiest sugary drink categories. Across all categories and brands, parents who purchased specific products rated them as significantly healthier than those who did not (P < 0.05). Over half of parents reported concern about caffeine, sugar and artificial sweeteners in sugary drinks that their children consume and approximately one-third reported that on-package ingredient claims were important in their purchase decisions.
   Conclusions: Nearly all parents provide sugary drinks for their children and many believe that some sugary drinks are healthy options for children, particularly flavoured waters, fruit drinks and sports drinks. Furthermore, many parents rely upon on-package claims in their purchase decisions. Given excessive consumption of added sugar by children in the home, there is a continuing need to address parents' misperceptions about the healthfulness of many sugary drink products.

AB Objective: To characterize energy and macronutrient intakes in Brazil and to describe the top food items contributing to energy and macronutrient intakes.
   Design: Two non-consecutive 24 h dietary records were collected and energy and macronutrient data were adjusted for usual intake distribution. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test were analysed using SAS version 9.1. Means and standard deviations were estimated for sex, age and income strata.
   Setting: Nationwide cross-sectional survey, 2008-2009.
   Subjects: Nationally representative sample of individuals 10 years old (n32 749), excluding pregnant and lactating women (n 1254).
   Results: The average energy intake was 7958 kJ/d (1902 kcal/d) and mean energy density was 6.82 kJ/g (1.63 kcal/g). Added sugar represented 13 % of total energy intake and animal protein represented 10 %. The mean contribution of total fat to energy intake was 27 %, while the mean saturated fat contribution was 9 %. Compared with the lowest quartile of income, individuals in the highest income quartile had greater mean intakes of energy, added sugar, alcohol, animal protein, total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and trans fat. Rice, beans, beef, bread and coffee were among the top five foods contributing most to the intakes of energy, carbohydrates, protein, fat and fibre.
   Conclusions: In general, Brazilians' dietary intake is compatible with a high risk of obesity and non-communicable chronic diseases, being characterized by high intakes of added sugar and saturated fat. Income may be a major determinant of diet nutritional characteristics.

AB Purpose: This study examined associations between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake and acculturation among a sample representing civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. adults.
   Design: Quantitative, cross-sectional study.
   Setting: National.
   Subjects: The 2010 National Health Interview Survey data for 17,142 Hispanics and U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites (>= 18 years).
   Measures: The outcome variable was daily SSB intake (nondiet soda, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, and sweetened coffee/tea drinks). Exposure variables were Hispanic ethnicity and proxies of acculturation (language of interview, birthplace, and years living in the United States).
   Analysis: We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the exposure variables associated with drinking SSB >= 1 time/d after controlling for covariates.
   Results: The adjusted odds of drinking SSB >= 1 time/d was significantly higher among Hispanics who completed the interview in Spanish (OR = 1.65) than U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites. Compared with those who lived in the United States for < 5 years, the adjusted odds of drinking SSB >= 1 time/d was higher among adults who lived in the United States for 5 to < 10 years (OR = 2.72), those who lived in the United States for 10 to < 15 years (OR = 2.90), and those who lived in the United States for >= 15 years (OR = 2.41). However, birthplace was not associated with daily SSB intake.
   Conclusion: The acculturation process is complex and these findings contribute to identifying important subpopulations that may benefit from targeted intervention to reduce SSB intake.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: High consumption of meat has been linked with the risk for obesity and chronic diseases. This could partly be explained by the association between meat and lower-quality diet. We studied whether high intake of red and processed meat was associated with lower-quality dietary habits, assessed against selected nutrients, other food groups and total diet. Moreover, we studied whether meat consumption was associated with obesity, after adjustment for all identified associations between meat and food consumption.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: The nationally representative cross-sectional study population consisted of 2190 Finnish men and 2530 women, aged 25-74 years. Food consumption over the previous 12 months was assessed using a validated 131-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. Associations between nutrients, foods, a modified Baltic Sea Diet Score and meat consumption (quintile classification) were analysed using linear regression. The models were adjusted for age and energy intake and additionally for education, physical activity and smoking.
   RESULTS: High consumption of red and processed meat was inversely associated with fruits, whole grain and nuts, and positively with potatoes, oil and coffee in both sexes. Results separately for the two types of meat were essentially similar. In a linear regression analysis, high consumption of meat was positively associated with body mass index in both men and women, even when using a model adjusted for all foods with a significant association with meat consumption in both sexes identified in this study.
   CONCLUSIONS: The association between meat consumption and a lower-quality diet may complicate studies on meat and health.

AB The 'taste of food' plays an important role in food choice. Furthermore, foods high in fat, sugar and salt are highly palatable and associated with increased food consumption. Research exploring taste importance on dietary choice, behaviour and intake is limited, particularly in young adults. Therefore, in this study a total of 1306 Australian university students completed questionnaires assessing dietary behaviors (such as how important taste was on food choice) and frequency of food consumption over the prior month. Diet quality was also assessed using a dietary guideline index. Participants had a mean age of 20 +/- 5 years, Body Mass Index (BMI) of 22 +/- 3 kg/m(2), 79% were female and 84% Australian. Taste was rated as being a very or extremely important factor for food choice by 82% of participants. Participants who rated taste as highly important, had a poorer diet quality (p = 0.001) and were more likely to consume less fruit (p = 0.03) and vegetables (p = 0.05). Furthermore, they were significantly more likely to consume foods high in fat, sugar and salt, including chocolate and confectionary, cakes and puddings, sweet pastries, biscuits, meat pies, pizza, hot chips, potato chips, takeaway meals, soft drink, cordial and fruit juice (p = 0.001-0.02). They were also more likely to consider avoiding adding salt to cooking (p = 0.02) and adding sugar to tea or coffee (p = 0.01) as less important for health. These findings suggest that the importance individuals place on taste plays an important role in influencing food choice, dietary behaviors and intake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Dietary total antioxidant capacity (DTAC) has been proposed as a tool for assessing the intake of antioxidants. The relationship between DTAC and blood glucose levels has been investigated mostly in healthy people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between DTAC and prediabetes morbidity in a case-control study.
   Methods: We examined 300 individuals with and without prediabetes (n = 150/group) who attended a Diabetes Screening Center in Shahreza, Iran. The anthropometric measures, physical activity, and blood glucose levels of all participants were measured. Food intake over the previous year was determined using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, and sex-specific, energy-adjusted DTAC was calculated using the U.S. Department of Agriculture's database. Logistic reg/ression was used to model the relationship between DTAC and prediabetes morbidity.
   Results: The mean DTAC was significantly lower in individuals with prediabetes than in the control group (P < 0.001). Across increasing DTAC quartiles, the participants had lower fasting blood glucose and 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose (P-trend < 0.02). After adjustment for body mass index; physical activity; education; dietary intake of fiber, fat, energy, and coffee; participants in the fourth quartile of DTAC were less likely to experience prediabetes compared with those in the first quartile (odds ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.49).
   Conclusion: The DTAC score appears useful when assessing the antioxidant capacity of diet and to better understand the relationship between diet and prediabetes morbidity. Future studies are needed to confirm the findings from the present study in other populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The mechanistic systems in the body through which tea causes weight loss are complex and multi-dimensional. Additionally, the bioactive components in tea such as catechins, caffeine, and products of tea polyphenol oxidation vary greatly from one major tea type to the next. Green tea has been the primary subject of consideration for investigation into the preventative health effects of tea because it contains the highest levels of phenolic compounds and retains the highest antioxidant capabilities of any major tea type. However, recent research suggests decreasing body fat accumulation has little to do with antioxidant activity and more to do with enzyme inhibition, and gut microbiota interactions. This paper reviews several different tea polyphenol-induced weight-loss mechanisms, and purposes a way in which these mechanisms may be interrelated. Our original short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) hypothesis' suggests that the weight-loss efficacy of a given tea is determined by a combination of carbohydrate digestive enzyme inhibition and subsequent reactions of undigested carbohydrates with gut microbiota. These reactions among residual carbohydrates, tea polyphenols, and gut microbiota within the colon produce short-chain fatty acids, which enhance lipid metabolism through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Some evidence suggests the mechanisms involved in SCFA generation may be triggered more strongly by teas that have undergone fermentation (black, oolong, and dark) than by non-fermented (green) teas. We discussed the mechanistic differences among fermented and non-fermented teas in terms of enzyme inhibition, interactions with gut microbiota, SCFA generation, and lipid metabolism. The inconsistent results and possible causes behind them are also discussed.

AB Objective To determine whether ingesting a green tea beverage enriched with catechins with a galloyl moiety during a meal reduces body fat in moderately obese adults. Design Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. Subjects A total of 126 obese subjects (25 <= body mass index < 30 kg m(-2)) were randomly assigned to a group receiving green tea beverages without catechins (placebo), or a group receiving green tea beverages with a low or high content of catechins with a galloyl moiety. Each subject ingested 500 mL bottled green tea beverages containing 25, 180, or 279.5 mg green tea catechins (0, 149.5, or 246.5 mg catechins with a galloyl moiety, respectively), at mealtimes for 12 weeks; the subjects were instructed to ingest the beverage during the meal that had the highest fat content on that day. Methods Anthropometric measurements and blood chemistry analysis were performed during the run-in period; at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 of the intake period; and at the end of the withdrawal period. Abdominal fat area was measured by computed tomography at weeks 0, 8, and 12 of the intake period and at the end of the withdrawal period. Results Both the low-and high-dose groups exhibited significant reductions in visceral and subcutaneous fat areas compared to the control group at 12 weeks post-intervention.

AB Laochuancha is an ancient tea plant originating from the Mingshan district of Ya'an city, Sichuan province, China, which is used to produce tea products with excellent quality. Mingshan Laochuancha green tea (MLGT) is a type of green tea manufactured from Laochuancha tea leaves. Currently, not much is known regarding the chemical compositions of MLGT and its bioactivity. Herein, the present study explores, for the first time, the chemical compositions and hypolipidemic activity of MLGT. It was observed that K was the most abundant element of 26.58 mg g(-1), and contents of toxic As, Cd, Cr and Pb elements were all below concentration limits. Alcohols (55.65%) were the main volatiles, and numerous volatiles with chestnut-like aroma were detected. Total content of 21 amino acids was 28.61 mg g(-1), and amino acids with velvety-like and umami taste totally accounted for 65.39%. The high content of amino acids and low ratio of polyphenols to total amino acids were attributed to strong umami and mellow taste of MLGT. Moreover, catechins and alkaloids were abundant in MLGT, where EGCG (85.82 mg g(-1)) and caffeine (33.78 mg g(-1)) were at highest content. Analyses of chemical compositions revealed excellent quality of MLGT. Correspondingly, MLGT showed potent hypolipidemic activity, and water extract of MLGT at 200 mu g mL(-1) significantly reduced lipid level to 43.06% of high-fat zebrafish. Results firstly revealed the quality characteristics of MLGT and provided further insights into bioactivity of Laochuancha.

AB Objective: To describe adolescents' eating patterns of traditional, global/non-local and mixed foods, and the factors that may influence food consumption, access and preferences, in a globalizing city.
   Design: A representative sample of school-going adolescents completed a cross-sectional survey including an FFQ designed to identify traditional and global foods. Student's t test and ordinal logistic regression were used to examine weekly food intake, including differences between boys and girls and between adolescents attending private and public schools.
   Setting: Vijayapura city, Karnataka State, India.
   Subjects: Adolescents (n 399) aged 13-16 years.
   Results: Compared with dietary guidelines, adolescents consumed fruit, green leafy vegetables, non-green leafy vegetables and dairy less frequently than recommended and consumed energy-dense foods more frequently than recommended. Traditional but expensive foods (fruits, dairy, homemade sweets and added fat) were more frequently consumed by private-school students, generally from wealthier, more connected families, than by public-school students; the latter more frequently consumed both traditional (tea, coffee, eggs) and mixed foods (snack and street foods; P <= 0.05). Girls reported more frequent consumption of global/non-local packaged and ready-to-eat foods, non-green leafy vegetables and added fat than boys (P <= 0.05). Boys reported more frequent consumption of eggs and street foods than girls (P <= 0.05).
   Conclusions: Adolescents' eating patterns in a globalizing city reflect a combination of global/non-local and traditional foods, access and preferences. As global foods continue to appear in low-and middle-income countries, understanding dietary patterns and preferences can inform efforts to promote diversity and healthfulness of foods.

AB Objective: To identify most commonly consumed foods by adolescents contributing to percentage of total energy, added sugars, SFA, Na and total gram intake per day.
   Design: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014.
   Setting: NHANES is a cross-sectional study nationally representative of the US population.
   Participants: One 24 h dietary recall was used to assess dietary intake of 3156 adolescents aged 10-19 years. What We Eat in America food category classification system was used for all foods consumed. Food sources of energy, added sugars, SFA, Na and total gram amount consumed were sample-weighted and ranked based on percentage contribution to intake of total amount.
   Results: Three-highest ranked food subgroup sources of total energy consumed were: sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB; 7.8 %); sweet bakery products (6.9 %); mixed dishes - pizza (6.6%). Highest ranked food sources of total gram amount consumed were: plain water (33.1 %); SSB (15.8 %); milk (7.2 %). Three highest ranked food sources of total Na were: mixed dishes - pizza (8.7 %); mixed dishes - Mexican (6.7 %); cured meats/poultry (6.6 %). Three highest ranked food sources of SFA were: mixed dishes - pizza (9.1 %); sweet bakery products (8.3 %); mixed dishes - Mexican (7.9%). Three highest ranked food sources of added sugars were: SSB (42.1 %); sweet bakery products (12.1 %); coffee and tea (7.6%).
   Conclusions: Identifying current food sources of percentage energy, nutrients to limit and total gram amount consumed among US adolescents is critical for designing strategies to help them meet nutrient recommendations within energy needs.

AB Background: Diet plays an important role in both the development and management of diabetes.
   Objective: Using data from the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study, we assessed dietary patterns associated with the clinical indicators of diabetes.
   Methods: This study included 7255 subjects aged 40-69 y. Individuals with chronic diseases were excluded. The daily intakes of specific food items were assessed using a dish-based semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire comprising 103 items; the food items were then grouped into 26 food groups. Dietary patterns were analyzed by the reduced rank regression method using glycated hemoglobin, the homeostasis model of insulin resistance, and fasting glucose concentrations as dependent variables. We investigated the associations between dietary patterns and incident diabetes using the Cox proportional hazards model.
   Results: During an 11.5-y follow-up, the incidence of diabetes was 11.8/1000 person-years. The dietary pattern related to selected biomarkers of diabetes was characterized by a relatively high intake of kimchi, beef, other meat, fish, and coffee in men and a high intake of rice, kimchi, and fruit in women. In men, the association of dietary patterns with incident diabetes was significant only in the obese group, and those in the top quartile of the dietary pattern score had a 1.72 times (95% CI: 1.15, 2.56 times) greater risk of incident diabetes than those in the bottom quartile. Conversely, dietary patterns in women were not associated with incident diabetes.
   Conclusion: Using reduced rank regression, we identified dietary patterns related to selected biomarkers of diabetes in a long-term study with follow-up data in Korea.

AB Introduction Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) is associated with changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and bioavailability of drugs, but whether these changes are induced by calorie restriction, the weight loss or surgery per se, remains uncertain. The COCKTAIL study was designed to disentangle the short-term (6 weeks) metabolic and pharmacokinetic effects of GBP and a very low energy diet (VLED) by inducing a similar weight loss in the two groups.
   Methods and analysis This open, non-randomised, three-armed, single-centre study is performed at a tertiary care centre in Norway. It aims to compare the short-term (6 weeks) and long-term (2 years) effects of GBP and VLED on, first, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (24 hours) of probe drugs and biomarkers and, second, their effects on metabolism, cardiometabolic risk factors and biomarkers. The primary outcomes will be measured as changes in: (1) all six probe drugs by absolute bioavailability area under the curve (AUC(oral)/AUC(iv)) of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe), systemic exposure (AUC(oral)) of digoxin and rosuvastatin and drug:metabolite ratios for omeprazole, losartan and caffeine, levels of endogenous CYP3A biomarkers and genotypic variation, changes in the expression and activity data of the drug-metabolising, drug transport and drug regulatory proteins in biopsies from various organs and (2) body composition, cardiometabolic risk factors and metabolic biomarkers.
   Ethics and dissemination The COCKTAIL protocol was reviewed and approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (Ref: 2013/2379/REK serest A). The results will be disseminated to academic and health professional audiences and the public via presentations at conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals and press releases and provided to all participants.

AB Objective: Intake of antioxidants may reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) by reducing oxidative stress. However, it is unclear whether dietary non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity (NEAC), which represents the cumulative action of dietary antioxidants and their synergistic effects in foods, is associated with decreased T2D risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between dietary NEAC and T2D.
   Methods: The study included 64 660 adults (27 809 men and 36 851 women), 44 to 76 y of age without history of T2D in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Dietary NEAC was estimated using databases of NEAC measurements compiled from results for three different assays: ferric reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP). A multiple logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of self-reported physician-diagnosed T2D over 5 y with adjustment for potential confounders.
   Results: In all, 1191 cases of newly diagnosed T2D were reported. Dietary NEACs were not significantly associated with T2D. The multivariate-adjusted ORs were 1.04 (95% CI, 0.88-1.23; P-trend = 0.56) for FRAP, 1.11 (95% CI, 0.93-1.32; P-trend = 0.26) for ORAC, and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.84-1.18; P-trend = 0.84) for TRAP. Similar associations were observed in men and women (P-interaction = 0.46 for FRAP, 0.35 for ORAC, and 0.63 for TRAP). In stratified analyses of major prooxidant factors, no notable associations with smoking and obesity status were observed.
   Conclusions: This finding suggests that dietary NEAC may not be appreciably associated with T2D in Japanese adults. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. A number of U.S. jurisdictions have levied volume-based specific SSB taxes. This study estimated baseline mean SSB prices across categories and sizes as this will help to determine the percentage increase in price resulting from the imposition of specific taxes.
   Data on food store SSB prices were collected in 2017 in Cook County, IL, St. Louis City/County, MO, Oakland, CA, and Sacramento, CA (N = 11,767 product-level observations from 581 stores). Data were weighted to represent volume sold by category and size. Mean prices per ounce were computed across categories and sizes. Linear regression models, clustered on store, were run to estimate associations between price per ounce and product characteristics, neighborhood (linked by census tract) characteristics, store type, and site.
   Weighted summary statistics show that the mean price of SSBs was 4.8 cents/oz. Soda was least expensive (3.4 cents/oz), followed by sports drinks (4.8 cents/oz), juice drinks (5.2 cents/oz), ready-to-drink tea/coffee (7.8 cents/oz), and energy drinks (19.9 cents/oz). Prices were higher for individual-sized (9.6 cents/oz) compared to family-sized drinks (> 1 L/multi-pack; 3.5 cents/oz). Regression results revealed that prices were lower in stores in majority non-Hispanic black tracts and varied by beverage characteristics and store type but not tract-level socioeconomic status.
   Given substantial variation in prices by SSB category, a penny-per-ounce SSB tax, if fully passed through, would increase soda prices by 29% versus 5% for energy drinks, highlighting the potential importance of different specific tax rates across beverage categories.

AB Background: The contribution of beverages to overall diet is of increasing interest to researchers and policymakers, particularly in terms of consumption of drinks high in added sugars; however, few tools to assess beverage intake have been developed and evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the relative validity of a new online Beverage Frequency Questionnaire (BFQ) among young adults in Canada.
   Methods: A cross-sectional relative validation study was conducted among young adults aged 16-30 years (n = 50). Participants completed a 17-item BFQ, a 7-day food record (7dFR), and a single-item measure of sugary drink intake. Pearson correlations and paired t-tests were used to evaluate correlation and agreement between the measures for 17 individual beverage categories, total drink consumption, total alcoholic beverage consumption, and two definitions of drinks with excess sugars. Cognitive interviews were conducted to examine participant interpretation and comprehensiveness of the BFQ.
   Results: Estimates of beverage intake based on the BFQ and the 7dFR were highly correlated, specifically for the total number and volume of beverages consumed, total alcoholic beverage consumption, sugary drink intake, and each of the 17 beverage categories with 3 exceptions: coffee or tea with sugar or cream, specialty coffees, and hard alcohol with caloric mix. Paired t-tests between the BFQ and the 7dFR indicated that the average reported volume was significantly different only for sweetened fruit drinks. The single-item measure of sugary beverage intake was not significantly correlated with the 7dFR. Cognitive interviewing demonstrated high comprehension levels, and confirmed the appropriateness of the BFQ beverage categories and sizes.
   Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that the BFQ performed well relative to a 7dFR and had high usability among this study population, indicating its promise for collecting population-level data on beverage intake, including sugar-sweetened beverages, which are known indicators of diet and health.

AB Beverages are among the first independent product choices that school-aged children will make and unhealthy choices can be a threat to children's health. The present study investigated which beverage attributes shape adults' and children's health perceptions. For this purpose, 100 children (fifty-two boys; mean age 8.8 (SD 1.1) years) and their parents were invited to independently perform a beverage-sorting task. Participants were asked to place twenty commonly consumed soft drinks in a line ranging from 'unhealthy' to 'healthy'. The sorting data were analysed using multidimensional scaling with property fitting and hierarchical clustering. Sugar content (beta parents = 20.78, beta(children) = 20.68; P<0.001), artificial sweeteners (beta(parents) = 20.68, beta(children) = 20.66; P<0.001), fruit content (beta(parents) = 0.33, beta(children) = 0.36; P<0.05) and caffeine content (beta(parents) = 20.45, beta(children) = 20.46; P<0.01) were found to be the predictors of parents' and children's health perceptions. Parents' and children's estimates were strongly related (r(s) 0.70 (SD 0.15)); both groups classified the beverages into similar clusters. However, compared with their parents, children perceived beverages such as fruit juices and grapefruit soda to be healthier. In conclusion, parents' and children's health perceptions were strongly related based on the same relevant attributes for evaluation. However, fruit content was considered a more important criterion by children, which might lead to differences in the health perception between children and their parents. Low fruit content and the belief of beverages being 'natural' could positively bias perceptions. Therefore, certain soft drinks such as squashes or fruit lemonades are problematic, and the consumer's awareness of their low nutritional quality should be raised.

AB This review examines the merits of 'food addiction' as an explanation of excessive eating (i.e., eating in excess of what is required to maintain a healthy body weight). It describes various apparent similarities in appetites for foods and drugs. For example, conditioned environmental cues can arouse food and drug-seeking behaviour, 'craving' is an experience reported to precede eating and drug taking, 'bingeing' is associated with both eating and drug use, and conditioned and unconditioned tolerance occurs to food and drug ingestion. This is to be expected, as addictive drugs tap into the same processes and systems that evolved to motivate and control adaptive behaviours, including eating. The evidence, however, shows that drugs of abuse have more potent effects than foods, particularly in respect of their neuroadaptive effects that make them 'wanted.' While binge eating has been conceptualised as form of addictive behaviour, it is not a major cause of excessive eating, because binge eating has a far lower prevalence than obesity. Rather, it is proposed that obesity results from recurrent overconsumption of energy dense foods. Such foods are, relatedly, both attractive and (calorie for calorie) weakly satiating. Limiting their availability could partially decrease excessive eating and consequently decrease obesity. Arguably, persuading policy makers that these foods are addictive could support such action. However, blaming excessive eating on food addiction could be counterproductive, because it risks trivialising serious addictions, and because the attribution of excessive eating to food addiction implies an inability to control one's eating. Therefore, attributing everyday excessive eating to food addiction may neither explain nor significantly help reduce this problem. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Nutritional labelling for healthier food or non-alcoholic drink

   ENERGY-INTAKE; IMPACT; MENU; CONSUMER; CHOICES; INTERVENTIONS; BEHAVIORS
AB Background
   Nutritional labelling is advocated as a means to promote healthier food purchasing and consumption, including lower energy intake. Internationally, many different nutritional labelling schemes have been introduced. There is no consensus on whether such labelling is effective in promoting healthier behaviour.
   Objectives
   To assess the impact of nutritional labelling for food and non-alcoholic drinks on purchasing and consumption of healthier items. Our secondary objective was to explore possible effect moderators of nutritional labelling on purchasing and consumption.
   Search methods
   We searched 13 electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to 26 April 2017. We also handsearched references and citations and sought unpublished studies through websites and trials registries.
   Selection criteria
   Eligible studies: were randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs/Q-RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies; compared a labelled product (with information on nutrients or energy) with the same product without a nutritional label; assessed objectively measured purchasing or consumption of foods or non-alcoholic drinks in real-world or laboratory settings.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted study data. We applied the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. We pooled studies that evaluated similar interventions and outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis, and we synthesised data from other studies in a narrative summary.
   Main results
   We included 28 studies, comprising 17 RCTs, 5 Q-RCTs and 6 ITS studies. Most (21/28) took place in the USA, and 19 took place in university settings, 14 of which mainly involved university students or staff. Most (20/28) studies assessed the impact of labelling on menus or menu boards, or nutritional labelling placed on, or adjacent to, a range of foods or drinks from which participants could choose. Eight studies provided participants with only one labelled food or drink option (in which labelling was present on a container or packaging, adjacent to the food or on a display board) and measured the amount consumed. The most frequently assessed labelling type was energy (i.e. calorie) information (12/28).
   Eleven studies assessed the impact of nutritional labelling on purchasing food or drink options in real-world settings, including purchases from vending machines (one cluster-RCT), grocery stores (one ITS), or restaurants, cafeterias or coffee shops (three RCTs, one QRCT and five ITS). Findings on vending machines and grocery stores were not interpretable, and were rated as very low quality. A meta-analysis of the three RCTs, all of which assessed energy labelling on menus in restaurants, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 47 kcal in energy purchased (MD 46.72 kcal, 95% CI 78.35, 15.10, N = 1877). Assuming an average meal of 600 kcal, energy labelling on menus would reduce energy purchased per meal by 7.8% (95% CI 2.5% to 13.1%). The quality of the evidence for these three studies was rated as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies. Of the remaining six studies, only two (both ITS studies involving energy labels on menus or menus boards in a coffee shop or cafeteria) were at low risk of bias, and their results support the meta-analysis. The results of the other four studies which were conducted in a restaurant, cafeterias (2 studies) or a coffee shop, were not clearly reported and were at high risk of bias.
   Seventeen studies assessed the impact of nutritional labels on consumption in artificial settings or scenarios (henceforth referred to as laboratory studies or settings). Of these, eight (all RCTs) assessed the effect of labels on menus or placed on a range of food options. A meta-analysis of these studies did not conclusively demonstrate a reduction in energy consumed during a meal (MD 50 kcal, 95% CI 104.41, 3.88, N = 1705). We rated the quality of the evidence as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies.
   Six laboratory studies (four RCTs and two Q-RCTs) assessed the impact of labelling a single food or drink option (such as chocolate, pasta or soft drinks) on energy consumed during a snack or meal. A meta-analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in energy (kcal) consumed (SMD 0.05, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.27, N = 732). However, the confidence intervals were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We rated the quality of the evidence as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies.
   There was no evidence that nutritional labelling had the unintended harm of increasing energy purchased or consumed. Indirect evidence came from five laboratory studies that involved mislabelling single nutrient content (i.e. placing low energy or low fat labels on high-energy foods) during a snack or meal. A meta-analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase in energy (kcal) consumed (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.14to 0.51, N = 718). The effect was small and the confidence intervals wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We rated the quality of the evidence from these studies as very low, providing very little confidence in the effect estimate.
   Authors' conclusions
   Findings from a small body of low-quality evidence suggest that nutritional labelling comprising energy information on menus may reduce energy purchased in restaurants. The evidence assessing the impact on consumption of energy information on menus or on a range of food options in laboratory settings suggests a similar effect to that observed for purchasing, although the evidence is less definite and also of low quality.
   Accordingly, and in the absence of observed harms, we tentatively suggest that nutritional labelling on menus in restaurants could be used as part of a wider set of measures to tackle obesity. Additional high-quality research in real-world settings is needed to enable more certain conclusions.
   Further high-quality research is also needed to address the dearth of evidence from grocery stores and vending machines and to assess potential moderators of the intervention effect, including socioeconomic status.

AB Background: Monitoring of serum lipid concentrations at the population level is an important public health tool to describe progress in cardiovascular disease risk control and prevention. Using data from two nationally representative health surveys of adults 18-79 years, this study identified changes in mean serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) in relation to changes in potential determinants of serum lipids between 1997-99 and 2008-11 in Germany.
   Methods: Sex-specific multivariable linear regression analyses were performed with serum lipids as dependent variables and survey wave as independent variable and adjusted for the following covariables: age, fasting duration, educational status, lifestyle, and use of medication.
   Results: Mean TC declined between the two survey periods by 13 % (5.97 mmol/l vs. 5.19 mmol/l) among men and by 12 % (6.03 mmol/l vs. 5.30 mmol/l) among women. Geometric mean TG decreased by 14 % (1.66 mmol/l vs. 1.42 mmol/l) among men and by 8 % (1.20 mmol/l vs. 1.10 mmol/l) among women. Mean HDL-C remained unchanged among men (1.29 mmol/l vs. 1.27 mmol/l), but decreased by 5 % among women (1.66 mmol/l vs. 1.58 mmol/l). Sports activity and coffee consumption increased, while smoking and high alcohol consumption decreased only in men. Processed food consumption increased and wholegrain bread consumption decreased in both sexes, and obesity increased among men. The use of lipid-lowering medication, in particular statins nearly doubled over time in both sexes. Among women, hormonal contraceptive use increased and postmenopausal hormone therapy halved over time. The changes in lipid levels between surveys remained significant after adjusting for covariables.
   Conclusion: Serum TC and TG considerably declined over one decade in Germany, which can be partly explained by increased use of lipid-lowering medication and improved lifestyle among men. The decline in serum lipids among women, however, remains unexplained.

ID FOOD CHOICES
AB BackgroundEating out is now common and food served out of the home is often of low nutritional quality. Kilocalorie (kcal) labelling of food and drink products sold in restaurant chains in the US is now mandatory, although in store kcal labelling practices among major UK restaurant and takeaway chains have not been examined.MethodsDuring August 2018, we contacted, visited the website and/or retail outlets of major eating out and takeaway food chains in the UK, including full-service and fast-food restaurants, cafes and coffee shops, some of which had previously made a voluntary pledge to provide kcal labelling. We examined the proportion of chains providing kcal information to customers at point of choice in store and the extent to which kcal information provision adhered to labelling recommendations. We also examined the proportion of chains that did not have point of choice kcal labelling but were able to provide kcal information on request. The study protocol was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework.ResultsOf the 104 eligible chains, only a small minority (18 chains, 17%) provided in store kcal labelling. Of those that did, provision of kcal information tended not to adhere to recommended labelling practices. Of the 16 eligible chains that had previously committed to a voluntary public health pledge to provide point of choice kcal labelling, labelling did not meet recommendations and 4 (25%) did not provide kcal labelling. Of the 86 chains that did not provide kcal labelling in store, kcal information was available on request from 43 (50%) chains.ConclusionsIt is rare for eating out and takeaway chains in the UK to provide point of choice kcal labelling and when labelling is provided it does not adhere to recommended labelling practices. Chains that previously volunteered to provide kcal labelling as part of an industry and public health partnership do so inadequately. Voluntary policies have not resulted in adequate kcal labelling in the UK eating out of home sector.

AB Unhealthful food-and-beverage advertising often targets vulnerable groups. The extent of such advertising in subway stations has not been reported and it is not clear how ad placement may relate to subway ridership or community demographics, or what the implications might be for diets and diet-related health in surrounding communities. Riding all subway lines (n = 7) in the Bronx, NY, USA, investigators systematically assessed all print ads (n = 1586) in all stations (n = 68) in 2012. Data about subway ridership came from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Demographic data on surrounding residential areas came from the U.S. Census Bureau. Data on dietary intake and diet-related conditions came from a city health-department survey. There were no ads promoting "more-healthful" food-or-beverage items (i.e., fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, water or milk). There were many ads for "less-healthful" items (e.g., candies, chips, sugary cereals, frozen pizzas, "energy" drinks, coffee confections, hard alcohol, and beer). Ad placement did not relate to the number of riders entering at stations. Instead, exposure to food-or-beverage ads generally, and to "less-healthful" ads particularly (specifically ads in Spanish, directed at youth, and/or featuring minorities), was directly correlated with poverty, lower high-school graduation rates, higher percentages of Hispanics, and/or higher percentages of children in surrounding residential areas. Correlations were robust to sensitivity analyses. Additional analyses suggested correlations between ad exposures and sugary-drink consumption, fruit-and-vegetable intake, and diabetes, hypertension, and high-cholesterol rates. Subway-station ads for "less-healthful" items were located disproportionately in areas home to vulnerable populations facing diet and diet-related-health challenges. The fact that uneven ad placement did not relate to total rider counts suggests ads were not directed at the largest possible audiences but rather targeted to specific groups.

AB Tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world next to water and is obtained from the leaves Camellia sinensis. In recent years, the potential health benefits and effect mechanisms of tea have attracted a lot of interest. The potential health benefits of tea have been attributed to its various phenolic compounds with unique biological properties found in tea. These phenolic compounds are especially catethins and their derivatives, which constitute at most 30% of the dry weight of the tea. Tea is a new and effective strategy for reducing the severity of neurological diseases and for protecting against obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer (ovaryum, lung, skin, breast, endometrial, prostate, bladder, oral and colorectal cancers).
   Overall, the study that supports the health benefits of tea is increasing. But, the amounts of and the frequency of tea consumption that is associated with potential health benefits vary greatly from work to work and this situation creates difficulty in determining the optimal consumption amount and frequency that tea can exhibit health benefits. For this reason, we aimed to examine the health effect of the tea and how much consumption is to investigate whether it meets the claimed health benefits.
   Within that frame, there is a need for more studies on the possible health effects of tea. While studying on that effect, the effects of various doses, forms (in synthetic or natural product matrix), exposure in different periods (short or long term) on health should be studied. However, currently the conducted studies are promising for tea is a bioactive component like polyphenol, theaflavins, thearubigins, caffeine and mineral. In addition, although the fact intake with diet proved to be reliable at the end of the conducted acute and chronic toxicity test is another positive part, safety of bioactive component in tea should be supported through further studies.

AB Background: Reducing the prevalence of obesity and chronic disease are important priorities. Maori and Pacific Islander communities living in Australia have higher rates of obesity and chronic disease than the wider Australian population. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the Good Start program, which aims to improve knowledge, attitudes and practices related to healthy eating and physical activity amongst Maori and Pacific Islander communities living in Queensland.
   Methods: The intervention was delivered to children aged 6-19 years (N = 375) in schools by multicultural health workers. Class activities focused on one message each term related to healthy eating and physical activity using methods such as cooking sessions and cultural dance. The evaluation approach was a quantitative uncontrolled pre-post design. Data were collected each term pre- and post-intervention using a short questionnaire.
   Results: There were significant increases in knowledge of correct servings of fruit and vegetables, knowledge of sugar and caffeine content of common sugar-sweetened drinks, recognition of the consequences of marketing and upsizing, and the importance of controlling portion size (all P < 0.05). There was also increases in knowledge of physical activity recommendations (P < 0.001), as well as the importance of physical activity for preventing heart disease (P < 0.001) and improving self-esteem (P < 0.001). In terms of attitudes, there were significant improvements in some attitudes to vegetables (P = 0.02), and sugar-sweetened drinks (P < 0.05). In terms of practices and behaviours, although the reported intake of vegetables increased significantly (P < 0.001), the proportion of children eating discretionary foods regularly did not change significantly, suggesting that modifying the program with an increased emphasis on reducing intake of junk food may be beneficial.
   Conclusion: The study has shown that the Good Start Program was effective in engaging children from Maori and Pacific Island backgrounds and in improving knowledge, and some attitudes and practices, related to healthy eating and physical activity. The evaluation contributes valuable information about components and impacts of this type of intervention, and considerations relevant to this population in order to successfully change behaviours and reduce the burden of chronic disease.

AB Background and aims: We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to summarize the evidence from prospective cohort studies regarding the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
   Methods and results: Pertinent studies were identified by searching Embase and PubMed through June 2014. Study-specific results were pooled using a random-effect model. The dose-response relationship was assessed by the restricted cubic spline model and the multivariate randomeffect meta-regression. We standardized all data using a standard portion size of 106 g. The Relative Risk (95% confidence interval) [RR (95% CI)] of T2DM was 0.99 (0.98-1.00) for every 1 serving/day increment in fruit and vegetable (FV) (P = 0.18), 0.98 (0.95-1.01) for vegetable (P = 0.12), and 0.99 (0.97-1.00) for fruit (P = 0.05). The RR (95% CI) of T2DM was 0.99 (0.97-1.01), 0.98 (0.96-1.01), 0.97 (0.93-1.01), 0.96 (0.92-1.01), 0.96 (0.91-1.01) and 0.96 (0.91-1.01) for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 servings/day of FV (Pfor non-linearity = 0.44). The T2DM risk was 0.96 (0.95-0.99), 0.94 (0.90-0.98), 0.94 (0.89-0.98), 0.96 (0.91-1.01), 0.98 (0.92-1.05) and 1.00 (0.93-1.08) for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 servings/day of vegetable (Pfor non-linearity < 0.01). The T2DM risk was 0.95 (0.93-0.97), 0.91 (0.89-0.94), 0.88 (0.85-0.92), 0.92 (0.88-0.96) and 0.96 (0.92-1.01) for 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 servings/day of fruit (Pfor non-linearity < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Two-three servings/day of vegetable and 2 servings/day of fruit conferred a lower risk of T2DM than other levels of vegetable and fruit consumption, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Most studies on dietary patterns have focused on the total daily intake of foods without differentiating intake at specific eating occasions. The aim of this study was to identify meal-specific (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) dietary patterns and examine their contribution to overall dietary patterns, using data from the 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey, Japan.
   Methods: Dietary intake was assessed with a 1-d weighed dietary record for 15 618 Japanese adults >= 20 y of age.
   Results: Using principal component analysis based on daily consumption of 22 food groups, four overall dietary patterns were identified: vegetable/fruit/fish/pulse, bread/dairy, meat/fat, and noodle/seasoning patterns. Four meal-specific dietary patterns, which were independently identified in the same manner based on consumption at each eating occasion, were as follows:
   Breakfast: rice/vegetable/fish/pulse/seasoning, bread/dairy/fruit/sugar, meat/egg/fat, and tea/coffee patterns;
   Lunch: bread/dairy, noodle/seasoning, meat/fat, and vegetable/pulse/potato/sugar patterns; and
   Dinner: meat/vegetable/seasoning, noodle/alcoholic beverage, fish/sugar/alcoholic beverage, and other grains/fat patterns,
   The major contributors to interindividual variation in the vegetable/fruit/fish/pulse overall dietary pattern included the rice/vegetable/fish/pulse/seasoning breakfast (28%), the vegetable/pulse/pota/sugar lunch (15%), and the fish/sugar/alcoholic beverage dinner (19%). For other overall dietary patterns, the major contributors were generally patterns with similar characteristics, namely the bread/dairy/fruit/sugar breakfast (33%) and the bread/dairy lunch (24%) for the bread/dairy overall dietary pattern; the meat/egg/fat breakfast (13%), the meat/fat lunch (33%), the meat/vegetable/seasoning dinner (28%), and the other grains/fat dinner (11%) for the meat/fat overall dietary pattern; and the noodle/seasoning lunch (51%) and the noodle/alcoholic beverage dinner (25%) for the noodle/seasoning overall dietary pattern.
   Conclusion: Major meal-specific dietary patterns were identified in the Japanese context, which differentially contributed to major overall dietary patterns. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Assessment of single nutrients or foods does not normally reflect the diet of population groups. Dietary pattern analyses are useful in understanding the overall diet and its relationship with disease conditions. The objective of the present study was to determine the dietary patterns and associated factors among schooling adolescents in Northern Ghana.
   A cross-sectional study involving 366 pupils in 10 junior high schools in the Tamale metropolis was conducted. A Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) which consisted of 60 commonly consumed foods was used to assess pupils' 7-day intake. Foods grouped (14) from FFQ data based on shared nutritional value were used to identify dietary patterns using principal component analysis (PCA). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between identified patterns and sociodemographic, anthropometric status, and household characteristics of pupils.
   Half of the pupils were female (50.3%) and average age was 15.6 +/- 2.0 years. PCA identified two dietary patterns which in total explained 49.7% of the variability of the diet of pupils. The patterns were sweet tooth pattern (STP) with high factor loadings for sugar sweetened snacks, energy and soft drinks, sweets, tea and coffee, and milk and milk products, and a traditional pattern (TP) which showed high factor loadings for cereals and grains, local beverages, nuts, seeds and legumes, vegetables, and fish and seafood. Logistic regression showed that pupils who lived with their parents [AOR = 1.95; 95% CI (1.1-3.4); p = 0.019], those who went to school with pocket money [AOR = 4.73; 95% CI (1.5-15.0); p = 0.008], and those who lived in the wealthiest homes [AOR = 3.4; 95% CI (1.6-7.5); p = 0.002)] had higher odds of following the STP. The TP was associated with high dietary diversity (p = 0.035) and household wealth [AOR = 3.518; 95% CI (1.763-7.017); p < 0.001)]. None of the patterns was associated with anthropometric status of pupils.
   Adolescents in the present study followed a sweet tooth or a traditional diet pattern which associated more with household- and individual-level factors but not anthropometric status.

AB The global shift towards diets high in sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and energy dense ultra-processed foods is linked to higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes and most other non-communicable diseases (NCDs), causing significant costs to societies and individuals. Chile has the highest SSB consumption in the world, very high junk food intake and very rapid increases in these poor components of the diet plus obesity prevalence. This study's purpose is to compare the effect of different tax policies for SSBs and ultra-processed foods on nutrient availability, utilizing price-elasticities, which are estimated from a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model, using the 2011-2012 Income and Expenditure survey from Chile. We take into account the high proportion of households not purchasing various food and beverage groups (censored nature of data) and endogeneity on total expenditures. The food groups considered were: sweets and desserts; salty snacks and chips; meat products and fats; fruits, vegetables and seafood; grain-based staples; ready-to-drink SSB; SSB from concentrate; plain water, coffee and tea; and milk, which together represent 90% of food expenditures. The simulated taxes were: (1) 18% price tax on all foods and beverages exceeding thresholds on sodium, saturated fat, and added sugar and for which marketing is restricted (based on a Chilean law, effective June 16, 2016); (2) 40% tax on SSBs (22% above the current tax level); and (3) a 1 Chilean peso (0.2 US cents) per gram of sugar tax on products with added sugar. Unhealthy beverages and foods are price-elastic (1.95 for salty snacks and chips, 1.30 for ready-to drink SSBs, and 1.27 for SSBs from concentrate), meaning that the change in consumption is proportionally larger with respect to a change in price. Results are robust to different model specification, and consistent among different socioeconomic sub-populations. Overall, the tax on foods and beverages high in fat, salt and sugar is associated with the largest reduction in household purchases of sodium, added sugar, saturated fat and calorie purchases. Chile is unique in currently having instituted a small current SSB tax as well as marketing controls and front-of-package labelling of unhealthy foods and beverages. The design of a more comprehensive tax to enhance the overall effect of these policies on healthier diets is a next critical step. This study shows that a tax on the same foods and beverages already delineated as unhealthy by the marketing controls and front-of-pack labelling should promote a healthier diet.
