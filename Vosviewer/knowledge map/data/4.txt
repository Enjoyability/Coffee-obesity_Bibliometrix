AB Coffee may protect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the roles of the caffeine and non-caffeine components are unclear. Coffee intake by 156 overweight subjects (87% with Type-2-Diabetes, T2D) was assessed via a questionnaire, with 98 subjects (all T2D) also providing a 24 h urine sample for quantification of coffee metabolites by LC-MS/MS. NAFLD was characterized by the fatty liver index (FLI) and by Fibroscan((R)) assessment of fibrosis. No associations were found between self-reported coffee intake and NAFLD parameters; however, total urine caffeine metabolites, defined as Sigma(caffeine) (caffeine + paraxanthine + theophylline), and adjusted for fat-free body mass, were significantly higher for subjects with no liver fibrosis than for those with fibrosis. Total non-caffeine metabolites, defined as Sigma(ncm) (trigonelline + caffeic acid + p-coumaric acid), showed a significant negative association with the FLI. Multiple regression analyses for overweight/obese T2D subjects (n = 89) showed that both Sigma(caffeine) and Sigma(ncm) were negatively associated with the FLI, after adjusting for age, sex, Hb(A1c), ethanol intake and glomerular filtration rate. The theophylline fraction of Sigma(caffeine) was significantly increased with both fibrosis and the FLI, possibly reflecting elevated CYP2E1 activity-a hallmark of NAFLD worsening. Thus, for overweight/obese T2D patients, higher intake of both caffeine and non-caffeine coffee components is associated with less severe NAFLD. Caffeine metabolites represent novel markers of NAFLD progression.

AB Coffee consumption has been associated with the reduction of several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. The aim of this review was to summarize the research conducted in the last five years (or older, when appropriate) on the relationship between the consumption of coffee bioactive compounds, obesity, and T2DM. A bibliographic search was performed using the Web of Sciences, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Keywords used were "caffeine," "coffee," "coffee consumption," "coffee extraction," "coffee bioactive components," "chlorogenic acid," "obesity," "antidiabetic," and "antiadipogenic." Epidemiological, clinical, animal, and cell culture studies were reviewed. Caffeine, chlorogenic acid, and diterpenes have been identified as potential bioactive compounds in coffee that exhibit antiadipogenic and antidiabetic effects. The concentration of these compounds in coffee depends on the coffee preparation method. The relationship between coffee consumption and obesity risk is inconsistent, as not all results report a positive association. The addition of sugar and cream may be responsible for these mixed results. The consumption of coffee and its constituents is consistently associated with a lower T2DM risk. Caffeine, chlorogenic acids, and diterpenes have antidiabetic properties and are associated with these effects. The available data do not allow us to draw a conclusion on the effect of coffee or its constituents on adipogenesis. Therefore, more tightly controlled human intervention studies are required for a deeper understanding about this relationship.

AB Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide, recognized for its unique taste and aroma and for its social and health impacts. Coffee contains a plethora of nutritional and bioactive components, whose content can vary depending on their origin, processing, and extraction methods. Gathered evidence in literature shows that the regular coffee consumption containing functional compounds (e.g., polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, and melanoidins) can have potential beneficial effects on cardiometabolic risk factors such as abdominal adiposity, hyperglycemia, and lipogenesis. On the other hand, coffee compounds, such as caffeine, diterpenes, and advanced glycation end products, may be considered a risk for cardiometabolic health. The present comprehensive review provides up-to-date knowledge on the structure-function relationships between different chemical compounds present in coffee, one of the most prevalent beverages present in human diet, and cardiometabolic health.

AB Atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular diseases, is influenced by modifiable factors such as adiposity and blood cholesterol. Diet is crucial in these areas, particularly regarding antioxidant, inflammatory, and obesity effects. Coffee, a globally popular stimulant beverage, has garnered significant attention for its potential impact on cardiovascular diseases. Recent insights reinforce the need to re-examine the relationship between coffee consumption and atherosclerosis progression. Coffee's complex composition includes polyphenols, renowned for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as well as potential weight-reducing effects. In addition, studies have demonstrated that certain coffee compounds such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acid can prevent atherogenesis by preventing the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins. Conversely, diterpenes, found in some coffee brews, can elevate cholesterol levels, posing a risk to coronary health. Notably, coffee intake has been shown to influence gut microbiota diversity, potentially contributing to anti-obesity effects. This review explores the insights from preclinical and clinical studies investigating the potential mechanisms through which coffee consumption may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis-highlighting the potential benefits of moderate filtered coffee consumption and the potential risks associated with excessive coffee consumption. Understanding this relationship is crucial for informing public health recommendations and guiding future research.

AB In previous studies, after regularly consuming a green/roasted coffee blend, body weight, body fat%, glucose, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), resistin, leptin, ghrelin, diastolic (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly changed in healthy and hypercholesterolemic subjects. However, glucagon, total-cholesterol (T-C), triglycerides (TG), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and Homeostasis Model Assessment index to estimate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) only changed in the hypercholesterolemics. This work looks into the antiobesity effects of coffee blend and into the relationship of antiobesity with the aforementioned cardiometabolic modifications in hypercholesterolemics. (1) Methods: Tricipital and subscapular skinfolds, hip, thigh, arm and waist circumference (WC) were measured in normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemics. To understand the relationship between cardiometabolic and antiobesity results in hypercholesterolemics, factor analysis was carried out using baseline values of the variables that changed. (2) Results: WC, WC/hip and WC/height showed significant coffeexgroup interaction, and in hypercholesterolemics tended to decrease. After factor analysis, three factors emerged, accounting for 29.46, 13.13 and 11.79% of variance. Only factor 1 (main loadings: WC, DBP and SBP, body weight, WC/hip and WC/height ratios, TG and ghrelin, inversely) decreased after coffee intake. (3) Conclusion: Regularly consuming green/roasted coffee may help to control body weight, and in hypercholesterolemics, may reduce cardiovascular risk by reducing abdominal adiposity and blood pressure.

AB Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide. It is usually identified as a stimulant because of a high content of caffeine. However, caffeine is not the only coffee bioactive component. The coffee beverage is in fact a mixture of a number of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, especially chlorogenic acids (in green beans) and caffeic acid (in roasted coffee beans), alkaloids (caffeine and trigonelline), and the diterpenes (cafestol and kahweol). Extensive research shows that coffee consumption appears to have beneficial effects on human health. Regular coffee intake may protect from many chronic disorders, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer. Importantly, coffee consumption seems to be also correlated with a decreased risk of developing some neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. Regular coffee intake may also reduce the risk of stroke. The mechanism underlying these effects is, however, still poorly understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the neuroprotective potential of the main bioactive coffee components, i.e., caffeine, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, trigonelline, kahweol, and cafestol. Data from both in vitro and in vivo preclinical experiments, including their potential therapeutic applications, are reviewed and discussed. Epidemiological studies and clinical reports on this matter are also described. Moreover, potential molecular mechanism(s) by which coffee bioactive components may provide neuroprotection are reviewed.

AB An overview of green coffee, the unroasted bean enriched with antioxidants, is presented in the following article. Green coffee beans are known to have a higher content of chlorogenic acid (CGA) with potential health benefits like activity against hypertension, diabetes, obesity, etc. There are three major classes of chlorogenic acids present in green coffee beans, namely: caffeoylquinic acid (CQA), di-caffeoylquinic acid (diCQA) and feruloylquinic acid (FQA). Another pivotal component of the green beans is caffeic acid. A compilation of the different research studies and reviews pertaining to the diverse biomolecules present in the green coffee, their structure and the different sources of CGA is presented. The traditional and modern methods of the extraction of CGA are also studied. Green coffee upon roasting develops its aromatic characteristics but the flavor development comes with a reciprocation of reduced chlorogenic acid content. Thus, the effect of processing is also addressed. There are numerous studies conducted to show the health benefits associated with the consumption of green coffee out of which, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects are particularly concentrated in this article.

AB Coffee is a beverage consumed globally. Although few studies have indicated adverse effects, it is typically a beneficial health-promoting agent in a range of diseases, including depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Coffee is rich in caffeine, antioxidants, and phenolic compounds, which can modulate the composition of the gut microbiota and mitigate both inflammation and oxidative stress, common features of the burden of lifestyle diseases. This review will discuss the possible benefits of coffee on complications present in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, outwith the social and emotional benefits attributed to caffeine consumption.

AB Objective: Obesity and overweight are challenging health problems of the millennium that lead to diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and atherosclerosis. Green coffee bean exhibited significant promise in healthy weight management, potentiating glucose-insulin sensitization and supporting liver health. The safety and efficacy of a novel, patented water-soluble green coffee bean extract (GCB70 (R) enriched in 70% total chlorogenic acid and <1% caffeine) was investigated in 105 participants for 12 consecutive weeks. An institutional review board and Drugs Controller General (India) (DCGI) approvals were obtained, and the study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.Method: Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, lipid profile, plasma leptin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and total blood chemistry were assessed over a period of 12 weeks of treatment. Safety was affirmed.ResultsGCB70 (500 mg BID) supplementation significantly reduced body weight (approximately 6%; p = 0.000**) in approximately 97% of the study population. About a 5.65% statistically significant reduction (p = 0.000**) in BMI was observed in 96% of the study volunteers. Waist circumference was significantly reduced by 6.77% and 6.62% in 98% of the male and female participants, respectively. Plasma leptin levels decreased by 13.6% in 99% of the study population as compared to the baseline value. Upon completion of 12 weeks' treatment, fasting glucose levels decreased by 13.05% (p = 0.000**) in 79% of the study population. There was a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c levels in both male and female participants (p = 0.000**), while 86.7% of the study participants showed a statistically significant decrease in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (p = 0.000**). The mean decrease in TSH levels on completion of the treatment was 14.07% in the study population as compared to baseline levels. Total blood chemistry analysis exhibited broad-spectrum safety.Conclusions: This investigation demonstrated that GCB70 is safe and efficacious in healthy weight management.

AB This study analyzes the effects on body composition and variables related to metabolic syndrome of two coffees with different degree of roasting and phenolic content. Sixty participants with body mass index between 25 and 35 kg/m(2) and a median age of 51.0 years (Interquartile range 46.3-56) were recruited. The study was a controlled, randomized, single-blind crossover trial consisting in drinking three cups/day of roasted coffee (RC) or lightly roasted coffee (LRC) during 12 weeks with 2-week wash-out stages before each coffee intervention. LRC contained approximate to 400 mg of hydroxycinnamic acids and approximate to 130 mg of caffeine per 200 mL/cup while RC contained approximate to 150 mg of hydroxycinnamic acids and approximate to 70 mg of caffeine per 200 mL/cup. Along the study, in each of the six visits, blood pressure, body composition by bioimpedance, anthropometric measurements, and blood biochemistry were analyzed. The mean differences and p values were calculated using a linear mixed model (JASP.v.0.18.0.3). A total of 38 participants completed the study. After the consumption of both coffees, fat mass and body fat percentage (LRC: -1.4%, p < 0.001; RC: -1.0%, p = 0.005) were reduced, whereas muscle mass and muscle mass percentage slightly increased (LRC: 0.8%, p < 0.001; RC: 0.7%, p = 0.002). The decrease in fat percentage was greater with LRC compared to RC (-0.8%; p = 0.029). There were no significant changes in metabolic syndrome variables or in body weight. In conclusion, LRC was slightly superior at inducing changes in body composition.

AB Epidemiological studies have suggested that coffee consumption is associated with a decrease in the risk of developing obesity and diabetes; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying these effects of coffee consumption remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effects of chlorogenic acid on energy metabolism in vitro. Hepatocellular carcinoma G2 (HepG2) cells were cultured in a medium containing chlorogenic acid. Chlorogenic acid increased the activity of mitochondrial enzymes, including citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), which are involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Proteome analysis using the isobaric tags for the relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) method revealed the upregulation of proteins involved in the glycolytic system, electron transport system, and ATP synthesis in mitochondria. Therefore, we propose a notable mechanism whereby chlorogenic acid enhances energy metabolism, including the TCA cycle, glycolytic system, electron transport, and ATP synthesis. This mechanism provides important insights into understanding the beneficial effects of coffee consumption.

AB This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, trends, and predictors of coffee consumption among Saudi female students and its association with anthropometric and demographic variables. A survey-based study using a face-to-face interview was designed, and 930 (aged 21.5 +/- 2.1 years) apparently healthy female students from different departments of King Saud University participated. The prevalence of coffee consumption was significantly higher (88.2%, p < 0.03) in the central Riyadh region. Coffee consumers had significantly higher prevalence of being overweight than non-consumers (p = 0.02). The frequency of coffee consumption was significantly higher (p < 0.02) in students who were single and belonged to families with a moderate income level. Coffee consumption was significantly higher among first-year students with a high-scale grade point average (GPA) (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively). Increased coffee consumption during exam and stress conditions was associated with unhealthy dietary habits such as using more sugar and spices. The prevalence of coffee consumption was high among Saudi females. High body mass index (BMI) and increased family income level were strong determinants for coffee consumption. Continued nutritional education and awareness about the potential positive and negative health effects of coffee consumption and the importance of food label use should be provided to younger generations in order to correct the wrong perceptions.

AB Coffee consumption has been related to a preventive effect against several non-transmissible pathologies. Due to the content of this beverage in phytochemicals and minerals, it has been proposed that its impact on health may partly depend on gut microbiota modulation. Our aim was to explore the interaction among gut microbiota, fecal short chain fatty acids, and health-related parameters in 147 healthy subjects classified according to coffee consumption, to deepen the association of the role of the (poly)phenol and alkaloid content of this beverage. Food daily intake was assessed by an annual food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Coffee consumption was categorized into three groups: non-coffee-consumers (0-3 mL/day), moderate consumers (3-45 mL/day) and high-coffee consumers (45-500 mL/day). Some relevant groups of the gut microbiota were determined by qPCR, and concentration of fecal short chain fatty acids by gas chromatography. Serum health related biomarkers were determined by standardized methods. Interestingly, a higher level of Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas was observed in the high consumers of coffee, who also had lower levels of lipoperoxidation. Two groups of coffee-derived (poly)phenol, methoxyphenols and alkylphenols, and caffeine, among alkaloids, were directly associated with Bacteroides group levels. Thus, regular consumption of coffee appears to be associated with changes in some intestinal microbiota groups in which dietary (poly)phenol and caffeine may play a role.

AB Objectives: The association between caffeine consumption and mortality in different weight statuses is unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of caffeine consumption on mortality in different weight statuses. Methods: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2014) was used in this study. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with appropriate sampling weight to assess the association of caffeine intake with mortality in different weight statuses. Results: A total of 37 211 participants were included in our study. Multivariate-adjusted analyses showed that moderate caffeine consumption was associated with decreased all-cause mortality in total participants (haz-ard ratio: 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.89). In subsequent analyses, a significant association was found between moderate caffeine consumption and all-cause mortality in overweight persons, but this asso-ciation was not found among other weight groups. In comparison with nonconsumers, the pooled multivari-ate hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in overweight persons were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.39-1.43) for those who had low caffeine consumption (<100 mg/d), 0.44 (95% CI, 0.22-0.89) for moderate caffeine consumption (100-<200 mg/d), and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.27-1.03) for high caffeine consumption (>= 200 mg/d). No associations were found between caffeine intake and cardiovascular and cancer mortality. Conclusions: The present study suggests that moderate caffeine intake is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in a large study of U.S. adults, especially among those who are overweight. Overweight individuals were more likely to benefit from moderate caffeine intake. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Traditionally, coffee-growing communities have used coffee leaves to make tea-like beverages valued for their rich phytonutrient content and ethnomedicinal properties. Among these phytonutrients, phenolic compounds, mainly mangiferin, found in Coffea arabica leaves, stands out for its potential therapeutic benefits, which may surpass those of coffee beans. Moreover, bioactive molecules in coffee leaves, such as mangiferin, trigonelline, caffeine, chlorogenic acids (CGAs), and rutin, contribute to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-obesity, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and neuroprotective effects. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these activities remain unclear. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the phytochemical constituents, ethnomedicinal uses, and potential applications of C. arabica and C. robusta leaves in functional beverages. Additionally, it examines the mechanisms through which coffee leaves exert their therapeutic effects. It emphasizes the need for further studies to fully understand the pharmacological benefits, structure-activity relationships, and the impact of processing on bioactive compounds and bio-functional characteristics. Optimizing processing methods to preserve and enhance these bioactive compounds is crucial. Thus, this review promotes a deeper understanding of coffee leaves' potential in the functional beverage market, encouraging further exploration into their bioactive properties.

AB Obesity is considered one of the most crucial health problems of the century. Therefore, reducing obesity is critically important. Caffeine (CF) and chlorogenic acid (CLA), which are substantial components in green bean coffee which maximize thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. In our study, we have prepared CF, CLA, and CF + CLA loaded-solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) since the SLNs are cost-effective, tissue-localized, and highly stable. The central composite design model was preferred to select the optimized formulation. UHPLC was used for quantification related to the CF and CLA amounts. The high-pressure homogenization (HPH) method was used while SLN formulations were prepared in the presence of poloxamer (R) 407 (surfactant) and Compritol (R) 888 ATO (solid lipid). The nanoparticles were characterized, followed by the utilization of 3T3-F442A cell lines for the evaluation of the adipogenesis activity of the formulations. Then, rt-PCR and ELISA studies of adipogenic markers were conducted. After optimal formulations were selected with an average of 110.2 & PLUSMN; 0.1 nm, CF (1 mM) + CLA (0.5 mM)-loaded SLN formulation has been proven significantly effective by using PPAR-?/C/EBP-a pathways. In a nutshell, our study has shown that CF + CLA loaded-SLN has been affected 45.8% times more than regular extracted coffee (p < 0.05) on the adipocyte cells.

AB Obesity is a complex disease spreading in the world. In our previous studies, chlorogenic acid (CGA) and caffeine had ever been reported to reduce the body weight gain and fat accumulation in mice. This study investigated the anti-obesity effect of CGA and caffeine on 3T3-L1 cells. According to triglyceride (TG) assay and Oil-Red O staining, 40 mu g/ml CGA and 160 mu g/ml caffeine reduced TG content. Moreover, CGA + caffeine inhibited the mRNA expression of major adipogenic markers, PPAR-gamma 2, and C/EBP alpha in the metaphase and anaphase stages of differentiation induction (Day 2 and 4). CGA + caffeine improved P-AMPK/AMPK accompanied by decreasing the expression of GPDH and FAS to depress the lipid synthesis, increasing the mRNA expression of ACO and CAT to promote fatty acid oxidation and up-regulated the expression of hydrolysis-related enzyme adipose TG lipase (ATGL) and P-HSL/HSL. Furthermore, CGA + caffeine improved the expression of Glut4 which promoted the glucose transport. Taken together, these data demonstrated CGA + caffeine inhibited 3T3-L1 cells differentiation in the middle and late stages and reduced the fat accumulation through AMPK pathway by regulating the fat metabolism-related enzyme in 3T3-L1 cells to attenuates adipogenesis.
   Practical applications The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential role of chlorogenic acid and caffeine in the treatment of obesity.

AB Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide; however, its impact on health outcomes and adverse effects is not fully understood. The current review aims to establish an update about the benefits of coffee consumption on health outcomes highlighting its side effects, and finally coming up with an attempt to provide some recommendations on its doses. A literature review using the PubMed/Medline database was carried out and the data were summarized by applying a narrative approach using the available evidence based on the literature. The main findings were the following: first, coffee may contribute to the prevention of inflammatory and oxidative stress-related diseases, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes; second, coffee consumption seems to be associated with a lower incidence of several types of cancer and with a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality; finally, the consumption of up to 400 mg/day (1-4 cups per day) of caffeine is safe. However, the time gap between coffee consumption and some drugs should be taken into account in order to avoid interaction. However, most of the data were based on cross-sectional or/and observational studies highlighting an association of coffee intake and health outcomes; thus, randomized controlled studies are needed in order to identify a causality link.

AB Purpose Coffee is rich in compounds such as polyphenols, caffeine, diterpenes, melanoidins and trigonelline, which can stimulate brain activity. Therefore, the possible association of coffee consumption with cognition is of considerable research interest. In this paper, we assess the association of coffee consumption and total dietary caffeine intake with the risk of poor cognitive functioning in a population of elderly overweight/obese adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods PREDIMED-plus study participants who completed the Mini-Mental State Examination test (MMSE) (n = 6427; mean age = 65 +/- 5 years) or a battery of neuropsychological tests were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Coffee consumption and total dietary caffeine intake were assessed at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the association between total, caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption or total dietary caffeine intake and cognitive impairment. Results Total coffee consumers and caffeinated coffee consumers had better cognitive functioning than non-consumers when measured by the MMSE and after adjusting for potential confounders (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.44-0.90 and OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.38-0.83, respectively). Results were similar when cognitive performance was measured using the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) and Trail Making Test B (TMT-B). These associations were not observed for decaffeinated coffee consumption. Participants in the highest tertile of total dietary caffeine intake had lower odds of poor cognitive functioning than those in the reference tertile when screened by the MMSE (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.47-0.87) or other neurophysiological tests evaluating a variety of cognitive domains (i.e., CDT and TMT-A). Conclusions Coffee consumption and total dietary caffeine intake were associated with better cognitive functioning as measured by various neuropsychological tests in a Mediterranean cohort of elderly individuals with MetS.

ID COFFEE; REPRODUCIBILITY; INCREASES; WOMEN; RISK
AB Objective: Caffeine is one of the oldest natural substances consumed by people. Its consumption in Poland has not been well described. The aim of this study was to design and validate an online food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) on caffeine intake and to use it to estimate caffeine consumption in Polish adults.Method: The FFQ was prepared and validated in a pilot study. The intake assessment was conducted in 2019-2020 on 372 respondents, aged 18 to 60 years. The FFQ included products such as coffee, tea, energy drinks, and carbonated drinks, as well as supplements and chocolate.Results: We showed good repeatability of the FFQ and it was considered a valid tool. The mean total caffeine intake among all participants was 426.7 mg +/- 283.4 mg/day of all sources; in women, it was 446.4 mg +/- 306.2 mg/day, while in men, it was 394.1 +/- 236.4 mg/day. Forty-three percent of the respondents consumed more than 400 mg of caffeine/day. Coffee was the main source of caffeine and contributed to 65% of total caffeine consumption. Women consumed 90% more green tea than men (p < 0.01). Overweight and obese people have 20% greater total caffeine intake (p = 0.01) and consumed 20% more coffee (p = 0.02) and 30% more black tea (p = 0.01) than people of normal weight.Conclusions: Average caffeine consumption among Polish adults slightly exceeds the safe consumption dose established by the European Food Safety Authority. Body weight status can differentiate caffeine intake.

AB BACKGROUND Chlorogenic acid is a type of phenolic acid found in many plants. Chlorogenic acid has an anti-obesity effect with an unclear mechanism. The present study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of chlorogenic acid on energy balance in high-fat diet (HFD) induced obese C57BL/6J mice administrated 100 mg kg(-1)chlorogenic acid for 13 weeks. RESULTS The consumption of chlorogenic acid ameliorated HFD induced obesity. Chlorogenic acid did not change the physical activity but significantly decreased food intake and increased body temperature, thermal dissipation and brown adipose tissue activity. Moreover, chlorogenic acid improved glucose tolerance but had a moderate impact on other blood indices. Additionally, chlorogenic acid failed to restore the microbiota change associated with HFD induced obesity, but modified the gut bacterial composition in a unique way. CONCLUSION Supplementation with chlorogenic acid can improve HFD induced obesity and associated glucose intolerance mainly via regulating food intake and energy expenditure.

AB Background: Coffee is among the most popular daily beverages in the United States. Importantly, coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of multiple health outcomes including a reduction in adiposity. DXA is a means to assess body fat and distribution.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the relation between coffee consumption and DXA-assessed adiposity and adiposity distribution.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data from the NHANES were used. Participants were adults aged 20-69 y from the 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 waves. Information on coffee consumption was assessed through the FFQ (categorized as no coffee, 0 to <0.25 cup/d, 0.25 to <1 cup/d, 1 cup/d, 2-3 cups/d, or >= 4 cups/d). Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption were included. Trunk fat and total fat percentage were measured via whole-body DXA scans. The association between coffee consumption and body fat was investigated using age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted linear regression models which accounted for sample weights.
   Results: Higher coffee consumption was associated with significantly lower total body fat percentage and trunk body fat percentage in a dose-response manner (all P values < 0.05) among women. Although this dose-response relation was nonsignificant among men, men aged 20-44 y who drank 2-3 cups/d had 1.3% (95% CI: -2.7%, 0.1%) less total fat and 1.8% (95% CI: -3.3%, -0.4%) less trunk fat than those who did not consume coffee. Furthermore, the association between coffee consumption and body fat percentage exhibited for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee among women (all P for trend < 0.001) but not among men (all P for trend > 0.05).
   Conclusions: The present study found a significant association between higher coffee consumption and lower DXA-measured adiposity. Moreover, a gender difference in this association in the general US adult population was also observed.

AB This study aimed to investigate the links between coffee (CF)/green tea (GT) consumption and body composition/cardiovascular parameters in middle-aged Japanese women. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 232 Japanese women aged 40-65 years who had been referred to the menopause clinic of Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital between November 2007 and August 2017. Body composition, cardiovascular parameters, and CF/GT consumption frequency were evaluated on their initial visits, using a body composition analyzer, vascular screening system, and brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire, respectively. We investigated the associations between variables using multivariate logistic regression. After adjustment for age, menopausal status, and other factors, daily CF consumption was inversely associated with high body mass index (BMI) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.96) and body fat percentage (BF%) (0.33; 0.14-0.82), and daily GT consumption with high BF% (0.36; 0.14-0.96). Daily CF + GT consumption was also inversely associated with high BMI (0.15; 0.05-0.50) and BF% (0.30; 0.12-0.74). In pre- and perimenopausal women, daily CF + GT consumption was inversely associated with high cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) (0.05; 0.003-0.743). In conclusion, daily CF/GT consumption was inversely associated with high BMI, BF%, and CAVI in middle-aged Japanese women.

AB Prospective epidemiological studies concur in an association between habitual coffee consumption and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Several aspects of these studies support a cause-effect relationship. There is a dependency on daily coffee dose. Study outcomes are similar in different regions of the world, show no differences between sexes, between obese versus lean, young versus old, smokers versus nonsmokers, regardless of the number of confounders adjusted for. Randomized controlled intervention trials did not find a consistent impact of drinking coffee on acute metabolic control, except for effects of caffeine. Therefore, lowering of diabetes risk by coffee consumption does not involve an acute effect on the post-meal course of blood glucose, insulin or insulin resistance. Several studies in animals and humans find that the ingestion of coffee phytochemicals induces an adaptive cellular response characterized by upregulation and de novo synthesis of enzymes involved in cell defense and repair. A key regulator is the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in association with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, AMP-activated kinase and sirtuins. One major site of coffee actions appears to be the liver, causing improved fat oxidation and lower risk of steatosis. Another major effect of coffee intake is preservation of functional beta cell mass via enhanced mitochondrial function, lower endoplasmic reticulum stress and prevention or clearance of aggregates of misfolded proinsulin or amylin. Long-term preservation of proper liver and beta cell function may account for the association of habitual coffee drinking with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, rather than acute improvement of metabolic control.

AB Obesity refers to the excessive accumulation of fat caused by a long-term imbalance between energy intake (EI) and energy expenditure (EE). Over recent years, obesity has become a major public health challenge. Caffeine is a natural product that has been demonstrated to exert anti-obesity effects; however, the mechanisms responsible for the effect of caffeine on weight loss have yet to be fully elucidated. Most obesity-related deaths are due to cardiovascular disease. Recent research has demonstrated that caffeine can reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease; thus, it can be hypothesized that caffeine may represent a new therapeutic agent for weight loss. In this review, we synthesize data arising from clinical and animal studies over the last decade and discuss the potential mechanisms by which caffeine may induce weight loss, focusing particularly on increasing energy consumption, suppressing appetite, altering lipid metabolism, and influencing the gut microbiota. Finally, we summarize the major challenges associated with caffeine and anti-obesity research and highlight possible directions for future research and development.

DT Review
DE Green bean coffee; Chlorogenic acid; Body weight; Obesity; Meta-analysis
ID EXTRACT; OBESITY
AB Background Supplemental green bean coffee extract (GBCE) with caffeine has been shown to prevent weight gain. There are different dosages of GBCE that contain chlorogenic acid (CGA), and the data for their effectiveness in preventing weight gain (500 mg/day) is currently out of date. To better understand the effects of GBCE containing CGA on body weight, the present study sets out to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of these studies.
   Methods Using electronic databases, including Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases, literature was searched up to October 13, 2022. For the meta-analysis examining the impact of GBCE containing CGA (500 mg/day) on body weight with a random-effects model, the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered. We calculated weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To gauge study heterogeneity, the Cochran Q statistic and I-squared tests (I-2) were employed.
   Results The meta-analysis includes three RCTs with 103 individuals (case = 51, control = 52). The combined findings of GBCE with CGA at least 500 mg/day result in body weight reduction (WMD: - 1.30 and 95% CI: - 2.07 to - 0.52, p = 0.001) without study heterogeneity (I-2 = 0%, p = 0.904) and without publication bias estimated using Egger's and Begger's test (p = 0.752 and p = 0.602, respectively).
   Conclusions According to the meta-analysis, GBCE with CGA 500 mg/day lowers body weight. Nevertheless, despite its limited sample size and short-term study, this study was successful. Long-term research on the effectiveness and safety of GBCE and CGA on body weight require more clinical trials.

AB We investigated the impact of recent caffeine drinking on glucose and other biomarkers of cardiometabolic function under free-living conditions while also accounting for lifestyle and genetic factors that alter caffeine metabolism and drinking behaviour. Up to 447 794 UK Biobank participants aged 37-73 years in 2006-2010 provided a non-fasting blood sample, for genetic and biomarker measures, and completed questionnaires regarding sociodemographics, medical history and lifestyle. Caffeine drinking (yes/no) about 1 h before blood collection was also recorded. Multivariable regressions were used to examine the association between recent caffeine drinking and serum levels of glycated Hb, glucose, lipids, apo, lipoprotein(a) and C-reactive protein. Men and women reporting recent caffeine drinking had clinically and significantly higher glucose levels than those not recently drinking caffeine (P < 0 center dot 0001). Larger effect sizes were observed among those 55+ years of age and with higher adiposity and longer fasting times (P <= 0 center dot 02 for interactions). Significant CYP1A2 rs2472297xcaffeine and MLXIPL rs7800944 x caffeine interactions on glucose levels were observed among women (P = 0 center dot 004), with similar but non-significant interactions in men. Larger effect sizes were observed among women with rs2472297 CC or rs7800944 CC genotypes than among rs2472297 T or rs7800944 T carriers, respectively. In summary, men and women drinking caffeine within about 1 h of blood draw had higher glucose levels than those not drinking caffeine. Findings were modified by age, adiposity, fasting time and genetic factors related to caffeine metabolism and drinking behaviour. Implications for clinical and population studies of caffeine-containing beverages and cardiometabolic health are discussed.

AB The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is 10.5% among adults in the age range of 20-79 years. The primary marker of T2D is persistent fasting hyperglycemia, resulting from insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. Multiple factors can promote the development of T2D, including obesity, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In contrast, dietary choices have been shown to prevent the onset of T2D. Oatmeal, lean proteins, fruits, and non-starchy vegetables have all been reported to decrease the likelihood of T2D onset. One of the most widely consumed beverages in the world, coffee, has also demonstrated an impressive ability to reduce T2D risk. Coffee contains a diverse array of bioactive molecules. The antidiabetic effects of coffee-derived polyphenols have been thoroughly described and recently reviewed; however, several non-polyphenolic molecules are less prominent but still elicit potent physiological actions. This review summarizes the effects of select coffee-derived non-polyphenols on various aspects of T2D pathogenesis.

AB Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Dietary intake of polyphenols may protect against the development of NCDs. Coffee is a rich source of phenolic acids in the Western diet that may prevent or treat hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, chronic liver diseases, and obesity. These health effects are attributed, at least partially, to the antioxidant properties and inhibitory activity of phenolic acids on lipases. However, the effect of milk on these properties is not clear. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the antiradical properties and inhibitory activity on pancreatic lipase in vitro of phenolic acids from coffee. We obtained commercial traditional and decaffeinated espresso coffee capsules and prepared the beverages according to the manufac-turer's instructions using a domestic coffee maker. Espresso prepared with traditional and decaffeinated coffee capsules were evaluated with and without the addition of milk following in vitro digestion. The total phenolic content ranged from 168.21 to 397.38 mg equivalent to chlorogenic acid/mL. All coffee-based beverages showed antioxidant activity, with emphasis on decaffeinated and milk-added beverages, respectively. Caffeic acid was the most abundant phenolic compound followed by 5-caffeoylquinic acid before digestion. In contrast after in vitro digestion, only caffeic acid was bioaccessible. The addition of milk improved the bioaccessibility of caffeic acid and caffeine. Overall, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the samples for pancreatic lipase varied between 222 and 3035.8 mu g/mL. Decaffeinated coffee had a greater inhibitory effect than regular coffee regardless of milk addition. In conclusion, decaffeinated and milk-added coffee beverages have a greater effect on lipase inhibition. This may be related to the greater bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds in these samples. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of enzymatic inhibition by phenolic acids.

AB Chlorogenic acid has been widely reported to profoundly influence preadipocyte differentiation but without consensus being achieved. In the current study, 3 T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated using adipogenic cocktail with or without chlorogenic acid. The influences of chlorogenic acid on the mRNA, lipid and phosphokinase profiles were evaluated using transcriptomic analysis, lipidomic analysis and phospho-kinase array assay. The obtained results showed that chlorogenic acid treatment during 3T3-L1 cells differentiation altered a series of genes transcription, resulted in obvious changes in the contents of various lipids, and inhibited phosphorylation of several adipogenesis-related kinases. Overall, the observed changes in transcriptomic, lipidomic and phospho-kinase profiles in the current study favor the findings that chlorogenic acid may inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. In conclusion, the findings from this study highlighted the therapeutic potential of chlorogenic acid for the treatment of obesity.

AB Background & aims: Higher consumption of coffee and caffeine has been linked to less weight gain and lower body mass index in prospective cohort studies. The aim of the study was to longitudinally assess the association of changes in coffee and caffeine intake with changes in fat tissue, in particular, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).Methods: In the setting of a large, randomized trial of Mediterranean diet and physical activity inter-vention, we evaluated 1483 participants with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Repeated measurements of coffee consumption from validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) and DXA measurements of adipose tissue were collected at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 3 years of follow-up. DXA-derived measurements of total and regional adipose tissue expressed as % of total body weight were transformed into sex-specific z-scores. Linear multilevel mixed-effect models were used to investigate the relation-ship between changes in coffee consumption and corresponding concurrent changes in fat tissue during a 3-year follow-up.Results: After adjustment for intervention group, and other potential confounders, an increase in caffeinated coffee consumption from no or infrequent consumption (<= 3 cups/month) to moderate consumption (1-7 cups/week) was associated with reductions in total body fat (D z-score:-0.06; 95%

AB Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of decaffeinated green coffee extract (DGCE) supplementation on anthropometric indices, blood glucose, leptin, adiponectin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in breast cancer survivors with obesity. Method: A total of 44 breast cancer survivors with obesity aged between 18 and 70 years and with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 31.62 +/- 4.97 kg m(-2) participated in this double-blind randomized clinical trial. Eligible patients were randomized to the intervention (n = 22) and control (n = 22) groups. They received two 400 mg capsules of DGCE or two identical placebos daily for 12 weeks. Serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, NPY, fasting blood sugar, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured at the baseline and after completion of the intervention. Also, weight, waist circumference, fat percentage, muscle percentage, and visceral fat were measured. Results: There were no significant differences in terms of changes of anthropometric indices and concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, NPY, and blood sugar between the two studied groups. Conclusion: Supplementation with DGCE in breast cancer survivors with obesity had no significant effect on anthropometric indices and blood glucose, leptin, adiponectin, and NPY levels.

AB This paper reviews provenance, chemical composition and properties of tea (Camelia sinensis L.) and coffee (Coffee arabica, L. and Coffea caniphora, L.), their general health effects, as well as the currently available knowledge concerning their action on fat storage, physiological mechanisms of their effects, as well as their safety and recommended dosage for treatment of obesity. Both tea and coffee possess the ability to promote health and to prevent, to mitigate and to treat numerous disorders. This ability can be partially due to presence of caffeine in both plants. Further physiological and medicinal effects could be explained by other molecules (theaflavins, catechins, their metabolites and polyphenols in tea and polyphenol chlorogenic acid in coffee). These plants and plant molecules can be efficient for prevention and treatment of numerous metabolic disorders including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Both plants and their constituents can reduce fat storage through suppression of adipocyte functions, and support of gut microbiota. In addition, tea can prevent obesity via reduction of appetite, food consumption and food absorption in gastrointestinal system and through the changes in fat metabolism.

AB Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing health concern with an estimated 462 million people having been diagnosed worldwide. T2D is characterized by chronically elevated blood glucose and insulin resistance, which culminate in a diminished function of the beta-cell mass in its later stages. This can be perpetuated by and result in inflammation, excess reactive oxygen species production, obesity, and the dysregulation of multiple cellular pathways. Many naturally occurring small molecules have been investigated in terms of their roles in modulating glucose homeostasis and beta-cell function. Many of these compounds can be found in commonly used sources of food and drink. Interestingly, a correlation has been observed between coffee consumption and T2D incidence. However, the specific compounds responsible for this correlation and their mechanisms are still somewhat undetermined. This paper reviews recent research findings on the effects of several polyphenols that are either found in coffee or are metabolites of compounds found in coffee (enterodiol, enterolactone, matairesinol, secoisolariciresinol, kaempferol, quercetin, and chlorogenic acid) on glucose homeostasis and health complications associated with glucose dysregulation, with a special emphasis on their potential anti-diabetic effects. The factors that affect polyphenol content in coffee are also addressed.

AB Background: Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a quinic acid conjugate of caffeic acid. It is an ester formed between caffeic acid and the 3-hydroxyl of L-quinic acid. This polyphenol is naturally present in substantial amount in the green coffee beans. Minor quantities of CGA arc also reported in apples, eggplant, blueberries, tomatoes, strawberries and potatoes. CGA is reported to he beneficial in hypertension, hyperglycemia, antimicrobial, antitumor, memory enhancer, weight management etc. Further, it is also reported to have anticancer, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Since the last decade, CGA drew public attention for its widely recommended use as a medicine or natural food additive suppletnent for the management of obesity.
   Objective: The current review explores the medicinal promises of CGA and emphasizes on its anti obese property as reported by various scientific reports and publication.
   Conclusion: CGA shows promises as an antioxidant, glycemic control agent, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, neuro-protective and anti-obesity agent. It primarily activates the AMP-activated protein kinase, inhibits 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase and strengthens the activity of camitine palmitoyltransferase to control the obesity.

AB Background: Recent studies have revealed some conflicting results about the health effects of caffeine. These studies are inconsistent in terms of design and population and source of consumed caffeine. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the possible health effects of dietary caffeine intake among overweight and obese individuals.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 488 apparently healthy individuals with overweight and obesity were participated. Dietary intake was assessed by a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and the amount of dietary caffeine was calculated. Body composition was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Enzymatic methods were used to evaluate serum lipid, glucose, and insulin concentrations.Results: Those at the highest tertile of dietary caffeine intake had lower percentage of fat mass, higher fat free mass and appetite score (P < 0.05). Also, lower total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) was observed in higher tertiles of dietary caffeine intake compared with lower tertiles. In multinomial adjusted models, those at the second tertile of dietary caffeine intake were more likely to have higher serum insulin (P = 0.04) and lower homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values compared with first tertile (P = 0.03) in crude model. While, in the age, body mass index (BMI), sex, physical activity, socio-economic status (SES) and energy intake -adjusted model (Model III), those at the third tertile of dietary caffeine intake were more likely to have low serum LDL concentrations [odds ratio (OR) = 0.957; CI = 0.918-0.997; P = 0.04]. With further adjustment to dietary vegetable, fiber and grain intake, those at the third tertile of dietary caffeine intake were more likely to have low systolic blood pressure (SBP), LDL and high HDL levels compared with those at the first tertile (P < 0.05).Conclusion: High intakes of dietary caffeine was associated with lower LDL, SBP, insulin resistance and higher HDL concentrations among overweight and obese individuals. However, due to observational design of the study, causal inference is impossible and further studies are warranted to confirm our findings.

LA English
DT Review
ID COFFEE CONSUMPTION; PRETERM BIRTH; GROWTH; OUTCOMES; RISK
AB Background Epidemiological studies reported inconsistent results on the associations between maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and risk of low birth weight (LBW) and childhood overweight and obesity in their offspring. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of cohort studies to quantitatively assess these associations. Pertinent studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase through June 2019. Study-specifics risk estimates were combined using fixed effects models, or random-effects models when significant heterogeneity was detected. Dose-response analysis was modeled by using restricted cubic splines. Results A total of 15 cohort studies, with 102,347 pregnancy women, was included in the meta-analysis. The pooled relative risk (RR) for LBW was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.57) for mothers with the highest compared with the lowest level of caffeine intake during pregnancy, with significant heterogeneity across studies (I-2 = 49.3%,P = 0.032). The pooled RR was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.11) for each 100 mg/day increase of caffeine intake. The pooled RR for childhood overweight and obesity was 1.39 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.69) for mothers with the highest compared with the lowest level of caffeine intake during pregnancy. No significant heterogeneity across studies was detected (I-2 = 38.9%,P = 0.179). The pooled RR was 1.31 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.55) for each 100 mg/day increase of caffeine intake. No evidence of publication bias was indicated. Conclusions Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with higher risk of LBW and childhood overweight and obesity. Further studies may focus on investigating the potential mechanisms before the recommendation of complete avoidance of caffeine intake during pregnancy.

AB Background: Coffee is one of the beverages consumed the most worldwide since ancient times. Previously, coffee used to be consumed due to its stimulating effect stemming from caffeine and its distinctive taste. In recent years, it has gone beyond being just a hot drink containing stimulating agents and has started to be consumed with the awareness about its positive effects on health. The compounds of coffee bearing antioxidant potential can be listed as caffeine, chlorogenic acids, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, nicotinic acid, ferulic acid, trigonelline, cafestol, and kahweol. Scope and approach: While it is reported that coffee impacts a range of chronic diseases including obesity, cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases due to the caffeine, chlorogenic acids, and diterpenoid alcohol it contains and that further research is needed in this respect, coffee is also related to a reduced risk of autoimmune diseases. This review aims to elaborate on the relationship between coffee consumption and the immune system. Key findings and conclusions: In addition, it has been highlighted in recent years that the above-mentioned compounds of coffee stimulate the immune system thanks to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The positive effects of coffee on the immune system stem from caffeine, chlorogenic acids, kahweol, cafestol and similar compounds it contains. Particularly caffeine and polyphenols are considered as the main agents nourishing coffee with immunomodulatory characteristics depending on the daily dose of consumption.

AB Background: A limited number of studies have reported that the possible effects of coffee intake on skeletal muscle mass, but the results have been inconsistently conclusive and there are no large sample studies concerning the U.S. population. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to explore the connection between coffee consumption and skeletal muscle mass in U.S. adults. Methods: The population for this cross-sectional study was drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2018. Appendicular lean mass was accurately obtained from DXA, and skeletal muscle mass was assessed using appendicular skeletal muscle mass adjusted for body mass index (ASMBMI). Coffee and caffeine consumptions were obtained on a 24-h dietary recall questionnaire. Furthermore, the associations between coffee and caffeine intake and skeletal muscle mass were evaluated using three multiple linear regression models and smoothed curve fitting. Subgroup analyses based on age, gender, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI) were performed to assess the robustness of these relationships. Results: This cross-sectional survey included a total of 8,333 participants. After adjusting for all covariates, higher intake of coffee, caffeinated coffee, and caffeine was associated with elevated ASMBMI (coffee: beta = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.02, P-value < 0.001; caffeinated coffee: beta = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.02, P-value < 0.001; caffeine: beta = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.04, P-value < 0.001). Meanwhile, smoothed curve fitting showed that coffee, caffeinated coffee, and caffeine intake were linearly and positively associated with ASMBMI. After further stratification by sex, age, and ethnicity, the positive relationships between coffee (especially caffeinated coffee) and caffeine intake and ASMBMI were not modified (P for interaction > 0.05). However, these relationships disappeared when the BMI over 30 kg/m(2). Conclusions: In general, consumption of coffee and caffeine is positively associated with skeletal muscle mass. Therefore, an appropriate increase in coffee and caffeine intake may be advocated in populations at high risk for low skeletal muscle mass.

AB Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is prevalent not only among the overweight and obese but also normal weight individuals, and the phenotype is referred to as a metabolically unhealthy phenotype (MUHP). Besides normal weight individuals, overweight/obese individuals are also protected from MetS, and the phenotype is known as a metabolically healthy phenotype (MHP). Epidemiological studies indicate that coffee and micronutrients such as plasma folate or vitamin B12 (vit. B12) are inversely associated with MetS. However, correlations among coffee consumption metabolic phenotypes, plasma folate, and vit. B12 remain unknown. Our objective was to investigate the correlation between coffee consumption, metabolic phenotypes, plasma folate, and vit. B12 as well as to understand associations between plasma folate, vit. B12, and metabolic phenotypes. Associations among coffee consumption metabolic phenotypes, plasma folate, and vit. B12 were assessed in a cross-sectional study of 2201 participants, 18 years or older, from 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). MUHP was classified as having > three metabolic abnormalities. Coffee consumption was not associated with metabolic phenotypes, but negatively correlated with several metabolic variables, including BMI (p < 0.001). Plasma folate was positively associated with MUHP (p < 0.004), while vit. B12 was inversely associated with MUHP (p < 0.035). Our results suggest the potential protective impact of coffee on individual components of MetS and indicate a positive correlation between coffee consumption and MUHP among overweight individuals. Identifying possible dietary factors may provide practical and low-cost dietary intervention targets, specifically for early intervention. Larger and randomized intervention studies and prospective longitudinal studies are required to further evaluate these associations.

AB Green coffee has weight management properties, yet its effects on appetite and satiety remain unclear as few, mainly acute, studies perform objective measurements. Therefore, the influence on appetite/satiety of acute and regular consumption of two nutraceuticals, a decaffeinated green coffee phenolic extract (GC) alone or combined with oat beta-glucans (GC/BG), with known satiating properties, has been analysed subjectively using visual analog scales (VAS) and objectively measuring actual food intake and postprandial appetite and satiety hormones. A randomised, cross-over, blind trial was carried out in 29 overweight volunteers who consumed GC or GC/BG twice a day for 8 weeks. After acute (day = 0) and regular consumption (day = 56) of the nutraceuticals, satiety was measured at 30, 60, 90, 150, and 210 min, as well as food intake at breakfast (30 min) and lunch (300 min). Additionally, in a subgroup of participants (n = 9), cholecystokinin, peptide-YY, glucagon-like-peptide-1, ghrelin and leptin concentrations were analysed in blood samples taken at the same time-points. According to VAS results, GC/BG reduced hunger more efficiently than GC. However, there were no statistically significant differences in food intake. Comparing the effects of the acute consumption of GC/BG and GC, leptin concentration at 150 min was higher after GC/BG intake vs. GC. Moreover, when comparing the effects of regularly consuming the two nutraceuticals, maximum ghrelin level decreased with GC/BG vs. GC. In conclusion, acute and regular effects of the nutraceuticals on appetite/satiety differed, and subjective and objective results partially agreed; GC/BG may reduce hunger more efficiently than GC.

AB Introduction: Coffee consumption has demonstrated an effect on the regulation of appetite, causing less hunger and/or greater satiety; however, its effects are not well known in woman with overweight or obesity. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of coffee consumption on hunger, satiety, sensory specific desire (SSD), and dietary intake in women with overweight or obesity. Methodology: A randomized crossover clinical trial was realized in 3 sessions: in the first session a clinical history, anthropometric measurements and body composition analysis were performed; in sessions 2 and 3 the participants randomly consumed 240 mL of coffee with 6 mg/caffeine/kg of weight or 240 mL of water along with a standardized breakfast. At fasting and every 30 min after breakfast for the next 3 h, appetite sensations and SSD were recorded using visual analog scales. Blood samples were taken at fasting, 30 and 180 min after breakfast. Dietary intake was recorded in the rest of the intervention days. Results: In the coffee intervention there was an increased desire for sweet foods, higher fructose intake during the rest of the day, and higher triglyceride levels than with the water intervention. No differences were detected in ghrelin or cholecystokinin. Conclusions: Coffee consumption may lead to higher triglycerides and higher intake of simple sugars, mainly fructose, through changes in the SSD.

AB Purpose High-maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy may be harmful for perinatal outcomes and future child health, but the level of fetal cumulative exposure has been difficult to measure thus far. Here, we present maternal dietary caffeine intake during the last trimester and its correlation to caffeine content in newborn hair after birth. Methods Maternal third trimester diets and dietary caffeine intake were prospectively collected in Kuopio Birth Cohort (KuBiCo) using a 160-item food frequency questionnaire (n = 2840). Newborn hair was collected within 48 h after birth and analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for caffeine (n = 316). Correlation between dietary caffeine intake and neonatal hair caffeine content was evaluated from 203 mother-child pairs. Results Mean dietary caffeine intake was 167 mg/days (95% CI 162-172 mg/days), of which coffee comprised 81%. Caffeine in the maternal diet and caffeine content in newborn hair correlated significantly (r = 0.50; p < 0.001). Older, multiparous, overweight women, and smokers had the highest caffeine levels in the maternal diet, as well as in their newborn babies' hair. Conclusion Caffeine exposure, estimated from newborn hair samples, reflects maternal third trimester dietary caffeine intake and introduces a new method to assess fetal cumulative caffeine exposure. Further studies to evaluate the effects of caffeine exposure on both perinatal and postnatal outcomes are warranted, since over 40% of pregnant women consume caffeine more than the current suggested recommendations (European Food Safety Association, EFSA recommendations).

AB The consumption of coffee and caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is part of many cultures worldwide. Their properties include serving as a neurostimulant aid, enhancing energy substrate levels, and improving general exercise performance. Both present therapeutic effects that can also be used to control chronic and metabolic diseases due to four mechanisms: adenosine receptor antagonism, increased catecholamine concentrations, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and a stimulator of calcium-release channels. Despite the individual genetic variabilities, distinct mechanisms have been demonstrated to improve physical performance, thermogenesis, lipolysis, insulin sensitivity, and hormonal modulation. Thus, coffee consumption and caffeine supplementation may enhance physical and mental performance and may improve metabolic variables, reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Current data reveal vital aspects of coffee and caffeine consumption in specific populations, although further studies are needed to define clinical interventions with caffeine in obesity and chronic conditions.

AB Chlorogenic acid (CGA) displays various biological activities in preventing high-calorie diet-induced metabolic complications. The absorption efficiency of CGA in the stomach and small intestine is relatively low, with approximately 70 % of CGA being metabolized by colonic microorganisms before it enters the bloodstream. In this study, we successfully developed CGA-LMP (Low-methoxy-pectin) conjugates to improve the absorption rate of CGA. C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diets (HFD) supplemented with CGA, LMP, or CGA-LMP conjugates for a duration of eight weeks. The results demonstrated that the CGA, LMP, or CGA-LMP conjugates prevented HFDinduced hyperlipidemia, inflammation, liver steatosis, and adipocyte hypertrophy in obese mice. Notably, the CGA-LMP conjugates demonstrated superior efficacy in alleviating obesity compared to CGA or LMP alone. Further studies revealed that the primary mechanism of weight loss was the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway, which facilitates lipolysis and lipid beta-oxidation. These findings highlight that the enhanced the antiobesity effectiveness of CGA-LMP conjugates, expanding their potential applications in the field of functional nutrition and foods.

AB Aims: Coffee intake is associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes among non -pregnant people. We aimed to investigate the association between caffeine, coffee and cola drink intake in early pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes (GDM). Methods: Kuopio Birth Cohort (KuBiCo) is a prospective cohort study including pregnant women who were followed at the prenatal clinics in outpatient healthcare centers and gave birth in Kuopio University Hospital, Finland (n =2214). Maternal diet during the first trimester of pregnancy was assessed using a 160 -item food frequency questionnaire. GDM was diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test according to the Finnish national guidelines mainly between 24 and 28 gestational weeks. Results: Women with moderate coffee intake in the first trimester were less likely diagnosed with GDM than women without coffee intake in an age -adjusted model (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76 -0.99; p = 0.03), but the association was attenuated in multi -adjusted models (p = 0.11). No association was found between caffeine intake and GDM. One third (32.4%) of pregnant women consumed caffeine over the recommendation ( > 200 mg/d). Women who consumed cola drinks more than the median (33.3 mL/d) had an increased risk of GDM (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.02 -1.63, p = 0.037) in multi -adjusted model compared to those who consumed less. Conclusions: Caffeine intake during the first trimester of pregnancy was not associated with the risk of GDM but a minor non -significant decrease was seen with moderate coffee intake. Although the average consumption of cola drinks was low in the KuBiCo cohort, higher consumption was associated with an increased risk of GDM. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safe amount of coffee during pregnancy, since the recommended caffeine intake was exceeded in almost half of the coffee drinkers.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: The leaves of Cecropia pachystachya Tre acute accent cul (Urticaceae), known as embauba, are used as hypoglycemic and for weight reduction in Brazilian traditional medicine.
   Aim of the study: This study investigated the effects of a pharmaceutical formulation (ECP20) containing C. pachystachya extract on some metabolic alterations caused by a hypercaloric diet in mice.
   Material and methods: Mice were randomly fed with a standard or hypercaloric diet and orally treated with ECP20 or vehicle for 13 weeks. Subsequently, adiposity, glucose intolerance, and the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were assessed. Adipose tissue and liver were collected after euthanasia and frozen at-80 degrees C for histological and antioxidant analyzes. The effect of ECP20 on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes was also investigated.
   Results: Animals treated with ECP20 showed less weight gain, reduced glycemia, glucose tolerance restored, and hepatoprotective effect. Also, ECP20 presented significant in vivo antioxidant activity. Treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with ECP20 did not inhibit cellular differencing.
   Conclusions: Therefore, ECP20 presented promising effects in the control of obesity and related disorders. Considering that glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia are strong evidence for the development of type 2 diabetes, the findings corroborated the traditional use of C. pachystachya to treat this disease. The chlorogenic acid and the flavonoids orientin and iso-orientin, present in the extract, might be involved in the activities found.

AB Coffee is an important dietary source of biologically active components, not to mention caffeine, phenolic acids, and diterpenes. It has been suggested that selected coffee secondary metabolites may beneficially modulate several mechanisms of anti-cancer protection. This literature review was intended to present current knowledge related to coffee and its components and hormone-dependent female cancers, such as breast. endometrial and ovarian cancer, and to identify gaps in research that may be exploited in the future. The search for studies was conducted through electronic databases. Publications on coffee composition. coffee preparation and brewing methods, in vitro and in vivo experiments with the use of substances naturally present in coffee, observational studies, and meta-analyses were collected. In population studies, the greatest attention has been paid to the anticancer effect of caffeinated coffee and/or caffeine. In general, most studies and meta-analyses indicated that there was no clear correlation between coffee and breast cancer or ovarian cancer. Some subgroups of women may benefit from coffee consumption. This is the case for post-menopausal women with regard to the risk of breast cancer and obese women with regard to the risk of endometrial cancer. This paper identifies a number of issues for future research, related to a better understanding of the anti-cancer mechanisms of coffee compounds and further research that would focus on specific target groups. taking into account both the different methods of coffee preparation and lifestyle factors that may influence the results.

AB Background: Meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that soft drinks may increase the risk of depression, while high consumption of coffee and tea may reduce the risk. Objectives were to explore the associations between the consumption of soft drinks, coffee or tea and: (1) a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and (2) the severity of depressive symptoms clusters (mood, cognitive and somatic/vegetative symptoms). Methods: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis based on baseline and 12-month-follow-up data collected from four countries participating in the European MooDFOOD prevention trial. In total, 941 overweight adults with subsyndromal depressive symptoms aged 18 to 75 years were analyzed. History of MDD, depressive symptoms and beverages intake were assessed. Results: Sugar-sweetened soft drinks were positively related to MDD history rates whereas soft drinks with non-nutritive sweeteners were inversely related for the high vs. low categories of intake. Longitudinal analysis showed no significant associations between beverages and mood, cognitive and somatic/vegetative clusters. Conclusion: Our findings point toward a relationship between soft drinks and past MDD diagnoses depending on how they are sweetened while we found no association with coffee and tea. No significant effects were found between any studied beverages and the depressive symptoms clusters in a sample of overweight adults.

AB Background & aims: Recent evidence suggests that moderate coffee intake is associated with multiple health benefits, including lower risk of obesity, sarcopenia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. However, to date, no study has evaluated these associations in kidney transplant recipients (KTR). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of habitual coffee con-sumption with obesity, sarcopenia, bone mineral density and CVD risk factors in KTR.Methods: This prospective 2 years-follow-up study included 170 KTR (59% men) aged 49.5 (42.0-57.0) years. At baseline participants were submitted to the following evaluations: clinical, laboratorial, dietary intake (including coffee), muscle strength, anthropometric and body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). After two years 163 KTR were re-evaluated by anthropometry, BIA and muscle strength. Sarcopenia was defined according to EWGSOP2. Risk factors for CVD were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome and hyperhomcysteinemia. Participants were stratified according to coffee intake: 0 or 1 time/day (Gr0-1) and 2 or 3 times/day (Gr2-3). Results: The median coffee consumption was 200 (150-250)mL/day and 112 (71-155)mL/100 0 kcal/day. At baseline, Gr2-3 vs. Gr0-1 exhibited significantly higher values of waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and presented a higher odds ratio for central obesity according to WHtR (2.68; 95%CI:1.19-6.02; p = 0.02) after adjustment for confounders. Coffee consumption (mL/1000 kcal/day) showed, even after adjustment for confounders, (1) a positive association with all parameters of body adiposity (anthropometry, BIA and DXA) and (2) a negative association with muscle quality index. After two years, coffee intake (mL/1000 kcal/day) at baseline presented a positive correlation with changes in fat mass (kg) by BIA (r = 0.22, p = 0.01) after adjustment for confounders.Conclusion: This study suggests that in KTR, higher coffee consumption is associated with increased adiposity, specially, central adiposity and lower muscle quality, but is not related with the other evaluated parameters.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

AB Caffeine, a substance discovered in plant raw materials over 200 years ago, has been extensively studied. However, many of the mechanisms of its influence on the human body have not yet been elucidated or have given contradictory results in experiments. The aim of this paper was to review and systematize current knowledge on caffeine and its impacts on the human body. A combined physiological and psychological effect of caffeine consumption has been shown to depend mainly on individual genotype and the frequency as well as degree of exposure to the substance. An example of this is the effect of caffeine on sports results, depending on the genotype as well as the effect on the cardiovascular system. People who regularly consume large amounts of coffee or tea do not have increased blood pressure, in contrast to occasional users. Caffeine has many positive properties, which include a slight increase in energy expenditure by increasing basal metabolic rate and promoting less fat gain, by potential reduction of the expression of genes associated with obesity, which can help maintain correct normal body weight and help its normalization.

AB The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the second largest country in the Arabian Peninsula and ranks 61st out of 150 countries in terms of coffee consumption. Excessive coffee consumption is associated with the risk of adverse health outcomes. This study aimed to assess awareness of the effects of coffee consumption and its relationship with insomnia among the adult population in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 431 adults in the Jazan region. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to the participants using an online survey. Data were analyzed using Statistical Program for the Social Sciences, Version 24.0. Of 431 participants, 377 (87.5%) consumed coffee. Females and married women consumed more coffee than their counterparts (91.3%, P < .01; 92.8%, P < .05; respectively), while students consumed coffee (85.2%) less than both the employed and unemployed (P < .05). The proportion of consumption increased from underweight (79.7%) to normal weight (88.5%), and as high as 91.3% among overweight/obese (P < .05). More than one-third of the participants (35.5%) preferred drinking coffee at coffee shops. The most preferred coffee was Arabic coffee (40%), and the major reason for drinking coffee was to change their mood (29.7%). More than half of the participants (54.5%) reported that coffee caused insomnia (P < .01). Awareness-raising initiatives for the negative effects of excessive coffee consumption are important. Longitudinal studies are required in the next stage of research to identify trends such as the motivations and profiles of Saudi coffee drinkers.

AB Obesity is coupled with an altered redox state and low-level inflammation. Oxidative stress may increase pre-adipocyte proliferation, adipocyte differentiation and mature adipocyte size. Regarding inflammation, the dysregulation of cytokine production by adipose tissue takes place in obesity, which is promoted by oxidative stress. Polyphenols may exert a positive effect on obesity, not only by modulating the redox state, but also due to their anti-inflammatory activity. Coffee, which is one of the most consumed beverages, is very rich in phenolic compounds. Bioavailability studies on coffee phenols have shown that the most abundant group of metabolites in plasma and urine are dihydrocaffeic (DHCA), dihydroferulic (DHFA), and hydroxyhippuric (HHA) acids, the three acids of colonic origin. To better understand the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of DHCA, DHFA, and HHA, an inflammation/oxidation model was set up in the pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 cell line using tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). After the exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mu M of TNF-alpha at different times, the cell viability, interleukin (IL)-6 secretion, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) were determined. Using the TNF-alpha prooxidant and proinflammatory conditions established (10 mu M, 24 h), it was observed that the physiological concentrations (0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mu M) of DHCA, DHFA, and HHA induced dose-dependent antioxidant effects according to the ROS, GSH, and antioxidant enzyme (glutathione peroxidase) results. In addition, reductions in the IL-1 beta, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) concentrations were observed to different extents depending on the metabolite (DHFA, HHA, or DHCA) and the concentration used. In conclusion, the main colonic metabolites from coffee chlorogenic acids may counteract TNF-alpha-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in the 3T3-L1 cell line, and thus, they present antiobesity potential.

ID METABOLIC SYNDROME; RISK
AB Objectives In observational studies, caffeine has been associated with a lower risk of obesity. However, whether the associations are causal and apply to coffee, which is a mixture of chemical compounds is unclear. Design Two sample Mendelian randomization study. Setting and Participants Genetic instruments predicting caffeine were extracted from an existing GWAS of serum metabolites in 1960 individuals of European descent. For coffee consumption up to 91,462 individuals of European ancestry with top SNPs followed-up in similar to 30,062 coffee consumers and up to 375,833 individuals of European ancestry were taken from two separate studies. Genetic associations with obesity classes (n= 263,407), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (n=210,086), waist circumference (WC) (n= 231,355), and hip circumference (HC) (n=211,117) were obtained from summary statistics of individuals of European ancestry from the Genetic Investigation of Anthropocentric Traits (GIANT). Methods The inverse-variance weighted method (IVW) was used as the main analysis. We also employed the weighted median approach (WM) and MR-Egger regression as sensitivity analyses. To gauge evidence of directional pleiotropy, we used Cochrane's Q test, and MR-PRESSO global test, as measures of heterogeneity between ratio estimates of variants. Results There was little evidence to support an association between blood caffeine and any anthropometric measure of obesity in the primary and sensitivity analyses. However, genetically predicted coffee consumption was positively associated with higher class I obesity and WHR. Furthermore, this association was maintained after correction for multiple testing (P < 0.05/6 = 0.008). Results from the GWAS of coffee consumption were in tandem with results from the GWMA, but associations with class I obesity and waist to hip ratio (WHR) were not maintained after correction for multiple testing. Conclusion We found little evidence that caffeine or coffee consumption protects against obesity, adding to growing literature suggesting that previous observational studies may have been confounded. This study demonstrates the dangers of ignoring genetic testing for targeted interventions and basing dietary policy recommendations solely on observational studies restricted to specific populations.

AB This study investigates the bioactivity retention of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and its metabolite dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA) by comparing their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesogenic properties in vitro. CGA, found in coffee, fruits, and vegetables, is metabolized into DHCA, potentially enhancing bioactivity. Antioxidant capacity was assessed in Caco-2 cells, with DHCA showing superior activity at lower concentrations than CGA. Anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, where DHCA exhibited significant dose-dependent inhibition of nitrite production, surpassing CGA. Anti-obesogenic potential was analyzed in 3T3-L1 cells, with DHCA demonstrating stronger inhibition of adipogenesis and notable downregulation of adipogenic genes like PPAR gamma and C/EBP alpha. These results suggest that DHCA's enhanced therapeutic potential due to its simplified structure and increased bioavailability. This study highlights the importance of metabolic transformations in dietary polyphenols for chronic disease prevention and management.

AB Background/Objectives Evidence regarding the influence of coffee on appetite and weight control is equivocal and the influence of covariates, such as genetic variation in caffeine metabolism, remains unknown. Herein, we addressed the novel hypothesis that genetic variation in CYP1A2, a gene responsible for more than 95% of caffeine metabolism, differentially impacts the association of coffee consumption with appetite and BMI among individuals with different genetic predispositions to obesity. Subjects/Methods A cross-over randomized intervention study involving 18 volunteers assessed the effects of coffee consumption on dietary intake, appetite, and levels of the appetite-controlling hormones asprosin and leptin. Data on habitual coffee intake, BMI, and perceived appetite were obtained from an observational cohort of 284 volunteers using validated questionnaires. Participants were stratified according to a validated genetic risk score (GRS) for obesity and to the -163C > A (rs762551) polymorphism of CYP1A2 as rapid (AA), intermediate (AC), or slow (CC) caffeine metabolizers. Results Coffee consumption led to lower energy and dietary fat intake and circulating asprosin levels (P for interaction of rs762551 genotype*coffee consumption=0.056, 0.039, and 0.043, respectively) as compared to slow/intermediate metabolizers. High coffee consumption was more prevalent in rapid compared to slow metabolizers (P = 0.008 after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI) and was associated with lower appetite perception and lower BMI only in rapid metabolizers (P for interaction of rs762551 genotype*coffee consumption = 0.002 and 0.048, respectively). This differential association of rs762551 genotype and coffee consumption with BMI was more evident in individuals at higher genetic risk of obesity (mean adjusted difference in BMI = -5.82 kg/m(2) for rapid versus slow/intermediate metabolizers who consumed more than 14 cups of coffee per week). Conclusions CYP1A2 rs762551 polymorphism modifies the association of habitual coffee consumption with BMI, in part by influencing appetite, energy intake and circulating levels of the orexigenic hormone asprosin. This association is more evident in subjects with high genetic predisposition to obesity. ClinicalTrials.gov: registered Clinical Trial NCT04514588.

AB Objectives
   Caffeine is a habit-forming substance consumed daily by the majority of pregnant women. Accordingly, it is important that women receive sound evidence-based advice about potential caffeine-related harm. This narrative review examines evidence of association between maternal caffeine consumption and negative pregnancy outcomes, and assesses whether current health advice concerning maternal caffeine consumption is soundly based.
   Methods
   Database searches using terms linking caffeine and caffeinated beverages to pregnancy outcomes identified 1261 English language peer-reviewed articles. Screening yielded a total of 48 original observational studies and meta-analyses of maternal caffeine consumption published in the past two decades. The articles reported results for one or more of six major categories of negative pregnancy outcomes: miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight and/or small for gestational age, preterm birth, childhood acute leukaemia, and childhood overweight and obesity.
   Results
   Of 42 separate sets of findings reported in 37 observational studies, 32 indicated significantly increased caffeine-related risk and 10 suggested no or inconclusive associations. Caffeine-related increased risk was reported with moderate to high levels of consistency for all pregnancy outcomes except preterm birth. Of 11 studies reporting 17 meta-analyses, there was unanimity among 14 analyses in finding maternal caffeine consumption to be associated with increased risk for the four outcome categories of miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight and/or small for gestational age, and childhood acute leukaemia. The three remaining meta-analyses were also unanimous in reporting absence of a reliable association between maternal caffeine consumption and preterm birth. No meta-analyses were identified for childhood overweight and obesity, although four of five original observational studies reported significant associations linking maternal caffeine consumption to that outcome category.
   Conclusions
   The substantial majority finding from observational studies and meta-analyses is that maternal caffeine consumption is reliably associated with major negative pregnancy outcomes. Reported findings were robust to threats from potential confounding and misclassification. Among both observational studies and meta-analyses, there were frequent reports of significant dose-response associations suggestive of causation, and frequent reports of no threshold of consumption below which associations were absent. Consequently, current evidence does not support health advice that assumes 'moderate' caffeine consumption during pregnancy is safe. On the contrary, the cumulative scientific evidence supports pregnant women and women contemplating pregnancy being advised to avoid caffeine.

AB Childhood overweight/obesity is a serious problem that has not been adequately addressed. As a key factor affecting weight gain, the association between dietary intake with childhood overweight and obesity is still unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between sociodemographic, lifestyle factors and dietary intake with overweight or obesity. We used data from a large cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The U.S. children aged 6-15 years with both weight data and dietary data were included. For univariate analysis of sociodemographic data, t tests was performed for continuous variables and chi-square tests was performed for discrete variables. Dietary intakes were described by median and quartile, and differences in dietary intake between children with normal weight and children with overweight or obesity were compared by rank sum tests. A modern statistical shrinkage technique, LASSO regression was used to examine the association between dietary intake and childhood obesity. Our study confirms that Hispanic ethnicity, increasing age, passive exposure to smoking, higher protein intake, and higher caffeine intake were positively associated with child overweight or obesity. Additionally, non-Hispanic White race, higher physical activity levels, higher household income, and higher vitamin A intake were negatively associated with child overweight or obesity.

AB Coffee and cocoa manufacturing produces large amounts of waste. Generated by-products contain bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, suitable for treating metabolic syndrome (MetS). We aimed to compare the efficacy of aqueous extracts and flours from coffee pulp (CfPulp-E, CfPulp-F) and cocoa shell (CcShell-E, CcShell-F) to ameliorate MetS alterations induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Bioactive component content was assessed by HPLC/MS. C57BL/6 female mice were fed for 6 weeks with HFD followed by 6 weeks with HFD plus supplementation with one of the ingredients (500 mg/kg/day, 5 days/week), and compared to non-supplemented HFD and Control group fed with regular chow. Body weight, adipocyte size and browning (Mitotracker, confocal microscopy), plasma glycemia (basal, glucose tolerance test-area under the curve, GTT-AUC), lipid profile, and leptin were compared between groups. Cocoa shell ingredients had mainly caffeine, theobromine, protocatechuic acid, and flavan-3-ols. Coffee pulp showed a high content in caffeine, protocatechuic, and chlorogenic acids. Compared to Control mice, HFD group showed alterations in all parameters. Compared to HFD, CcShell-F significantly reduced adipocyte size, increased browning and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and normalized basal glycemia, while CcShell-E only increased HDL. Both coffee pulp ingredients normalized adipocyte size, basal glycemia, and GTT-AUC. Additionally, CfPulp-E improved hyperleptinemia, reduced triglycerides, and slowed weight gain, and CfPulp-F increased HDL. In conclusion, coffee pulp ingredients showed a better efficacy against MetS, likely due to the synergic effect of caffeine, protocatechuic, and chlorogenic acids. Since coffee pulp is already approved as a food ingredient, this by-product could be used in humans to treat obesity-related MetS alterations.

AB Background/Objectives Most studies assessing the association between coffee consumption and hypertension ascertained caffeine intake in terms of number of cups per days, and yield mixed results. Although the inter-individuals variability in the caffeine metabolism is known, the relation of caffeine metabolites with hypertension remains unsettled. We examined the association of caffeine and 13 direct and indirect caffeine metabolites with hypertension in U.S. adults. Methods Using data from 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we included 2278 individuals aged 18 to 80 years. Urinary methyluric acids (MU) and methylxanthines (MX) products of caffeine metabolism were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. We used multivariate logistic regression to model hypertension (systolic blood pressure >= 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >= 80 mmHg) as functions of urinary coffee metabolites. Results The odds of hypertension decreased across quartiles of 3-MU, 7-MU, 3-MX and 7-MX, with 7-MU being the more powerful metabolite. Compared with adults in the bottom quartile of 7-MU, the odds of hypertension decreased by 81% (95% CI: -90 to -22%) in those in the upper quartile. In contrast, the odds ratio for being hypertensive from the bottom to the upper quartile were 4.47 (95% CI: 1.21-16.50) for 1,3-dimethyluric acid, 4.45 (95% CI: 1.48-13.39) for 1,3-dimethylxanthine, and 5.08 (95% CI: 1.11-23.36) for 1,7-dimethylxanthine. Neither insulin resistance nor abdominal obesity were moderators in these associations. Conclusions Final metabolites of caffeine (namely 3-MU, 7-MU, 3-MX and 7-MX), but not caffeine, significantly reduce the odds for hypertension in this population.

AB Dietary supplements for weight management include myriad ingredients with thermogenic, lipotropic, satiety, and other metabolic effects. Recently, the safety of this product category has been questioned. In this review, we summarize the safety evidence as well as relevant clinical findings on weight management and metabolic effects of six representative dietary supplement ingredients: caffeine, green tea extract (GTE), green coffee bean extract (GCBE), choline, glucomannan, and capsaicinoids and capsinoids. Of these, caffeine, GTE (specifically epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG]), and choline have recommended intake limits, which appear not to be exceeded when used according to manufacturers' instructions. Serious adverse events from supplements with these ingredients are rare and typically involve unusually high intakes. As with any dietary component, the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance, as well as possible interactions with concomitant medications/supplements exist, and the health status of the consumer should be considered when consuming these components. Most of the ingredients reviewed also improved markers of metabolic health, such as glucose, lipids, and blood pressure, although the data are limited for some. In summary, weight management supplements containing caffeine, GTE, GCBE, choline, glucomannan, and capsaicinoids and capsinoids are generally safe when taken as directed and demonstrate metabolic health benefits for overweight and obese people.

AB Several epidemiological studies and clinical trials have reported the beneficial effects of green tea, coffee, wine, and curry on human health, with its anti-obesity, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and neuroprotective properties. These effects, which have been supported using cell-based and animal studies, are mainly attributed to epigallocatechin gallate found in green tea, chlorogenic acid in coffee, resveratrol in wine, and curcumin in curry. Polyphenols are proposed to function via various mechanisms, the most important of which is related to reactive oxygen species (ROS). These polyphenols exert conflicting dual actions as anti- and pro-oxidants. Their anti-oxidative actions help scavenge ROS and downregulate nuclear factor-kappa B to produce favorable anti-inflammatory effects. Meanwhile, pro-oxidant actions appear to promote ROS generation leading to the activation of 5 '-AMP-activated protein kinase, which modulates different enzymes and factors with health beneficial roles. Currently, it remains unclear how these polyphenols exert either pro- or anti-oxidant effects. Similarly, several human studies showed no beneficial effects of these foods, and, by extension polyphenols, on obesity. These inconsistencies may be attributed to different confounding study factors. Thus, this review provides a state-of-the-art update on these foods and their principal polyphenol components, with an assumption that it prevents obesity.

AB Background & aims The nutrition transition in developing countries like Iran causes the increasing rise of obesity and abdominal obesity rates. However, it is not yet well proven that environmental modifications like improving the quality of beverage intake can be effective in people who have a genetic predisposition to obesity. So, in the present study, we examine the interaction between genetic predisposition and healthy beverage index (HBI) with abdominal obesity and obesity-related metabolic risk factors in overweight and obese women. Method Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 202 overweight or obese females were chosen for this cross-sectional study. Body composition, anthropometric measures, physical activity, and beverage intake data were collected and analyzed using recognized and trustworthy methodologies. Biochemical tests were performed on serum samples. A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated based on the results of genetic tests. The predetermined HBI was calculated based on previous studies. A generalized linear model was used to estimate the interactions between GRS and HBI (GLM). Results We found significant interactions between GRS and HBI on WHR (beta = - 0.39, CI: -0.07 to 0.001, P = 0.05) and WC (beta = - 6.18, CI: - 13.41 to 1.05, P = 0.09). Also, there were significant gene-diet interactions for HBI and GRS on HDL (beta = 7.09, CI: - 0.73 to 14.92, P = 0.07) and FBS (beta = - 9.07, CI: - 18.63 to 0.47, P = 0.06). Conclusions These findings emphasize the HBI considering genetics appears to protect against the risks of abdominal obesity and metabolic associated obesity markers.

AB Background and Objective: Obesity is a condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to such an extent that it may hurt health correlated with various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. The present study represents the evaluation result of green coffee beans compared to anti obese orlistat drug in some physiological vital parameters levels among obese male humans. Materials and Methods: Sixty males of age 30 years or older were recruited for the study and divided into four groups each of 15 persons done among Jordanian people at Al-Mafraq city in Jordan for one month. Group 1 received 120 mg orlistat once daily, Group 2 have taken 350 mg green coffee beans 3 times daily, Group 3 have taken the combination of orlistat and green coffee as the previous daily table and group 4 was a control group that didn't receive either orlistat or green coffee. Results: The present data showed that green coffee beans exerted a reduction of about 15-21% in fast blood glucose and lipid parameters (cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDH) in addition to a 32% increase in HDL. On the other hand, orlistat showed less effect on these parameters about 8-13%. No noticeable effect of either green coffee or orlistat on blood pressure. Among physiological minerals, Mg increased significantly (30%) due to green coffee uptake compared to a similar effect of orlistat, whereas, other minerals (Zn, Ca, Mg) and vitamin B12 were not affected in the presence of either green coffee or orlistat. The combination of green coffee and orlistat didn't exert an additive effect on all parameters. Conclusion: Green coffee may be recommended to improve some physiological parameters such as the reduction in cholesterol, triglyceride, LDH and an increase in HDL levels. Moreover, an increase in Mg levels in obese people.

AB The objective was to examine the effectiveness of mate tea (MT, Ilex paraguariensis St. Hilaire) and caffeine from mate tea (MC) on in vitro lipid accumulation and in vivo diet-driven-obesity. MC and decaffeinated mate (DM) were obtained using supercritical CO2 extraction and mainly composed of caffeine and caffeoylquinic acids, respectively. MC reduced lipid accumulation (41%) via downregulation of fatty acid synthase (Fasn) (39%) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Rats fed a high-fat-high-sucrose-diet and 0.1% of caffeine from MC, MT, or DM. MC attenuated weight gain (16%) and body fat accumulation (22%). MC reduced Fasn expression in both adipose tissue (66%) and liver (37%). MC diminished pyruvate kinase (PK, 59%) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP, 50%) hepatic expression. In silica, neochlorogenic acid interacted with PK and MTP allosteric sites. FAS beta-ketoacyl reductase domain showed the highest affinity to 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid. Caffeine suppressed lipid accumulation and body weight gain, through the modulation of lipogenic gene expression.

AB This study aimed to assess the effect of unroasted, dark and very dark roasted coffee on obesity and metabolic disorders in obese rats. All coffee samples significantly reduced weight gain (-17%) compared to obese control. Coffee reduced glucose levels (-17%) upon a glucose tolerance test in all cases compared to the control, while fasting glucose only decreased (-26%) with very dark coffee. Insulin levels and insulin resistance significantly decreased (-77% and 65% respectively) with all coffee samples compared to the control. Unroasted and dark roasted coffee decreased triglycerides (-21% and -11%, respectively), and unroasted coffee also reduced free fatty acids (-43%) and adipocyte size. Coffee decreased liver steatosis (-55%) and Caspase-3 levels (-27%), regardless of the roasting degree. Overall, coffee plays a positive role in restraining obesity and related metabolic disorders but, depending on the metabolic pathway and relevant marker, an effect of roasting could be either found or not.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of roasting coffee degree on inflammatory (NF-k beta F-6 and TNF-alpha) and stress oxidative markers (malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) end product concentrations, catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in high-fructose and saturated fat (HFSFD)-fed rats. Roasting was performed using hot air circulation (200 degrees C) for 45 and 60 min, obtaining dark and very dark coffee, respectively. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive a) unroasted coffee, b) dark coffee, c) very dark coffee, or distilled water for the control group (n = 8). Coffee brews (7.4 mL/per day equivalent to 75 mL/day in humans) were given by gavage for sixteen weeks. All treated groups significantly decreased NF-k beta F-6 (similar to 30 % for unroasted, similar to 50 % for dark, and similar to 75 % for very dark group) and TNF-alpha in the liver compared with the control group. Additionally, TNF-alpha showed a significant reduction in all treatment groups (similar to 26 % for unroasted and dark groups, and similar to 39 % for very dark group) in adipose tissue (AT) compared with the negative control. Regarding oxidative stress makers, all coffee brews exerted antioxidant effects in serum, AT, liver, kidney, and heart.
   Our results revealed that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of coffee vary according to the roasting degree in HFSFD-fed rats.

AB This study aimed to investigate the impact of different doses of chlorogenic acid and Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide on lipid accumulation using an obese rat model. We utilized blood glucose assays, oil red O staining, and triglyceride content analysis to examine the effects of chlorogenic acid combined with G. lucidum polysaccharide on fat metabolism in rats. We found substantial potential in using chlorogenic acid combined with G. lucidum polysaccharide for weight control and metabolic regulation in obese rats. After a long-term dietary intervention, chlorogenic acid and G. lucidum polysaccharide markedly inhibited the expression of proteins related to fatty acid synthesis, including AMP -activated protein kinase, fatty acid synthase, and SREBP-1c, leading to reduced body weight and decreased hepatic fat deposition. Additionally, the combined treatment substantially affected enzymes and proteins involved in glucose metabolism, reducing glycogen synthase expression and indicating a potential mechanism for weight reduction through glycogen synthesis inhibition. Furthermore, elevated glucose kinase levels indicated that chlorogenic acid and G. lucidum polysaccharide may enhance hepatic glycogen degradation, thereby reducing hepatic fat accumulation. These findings reveal that chlorogenic acid combined with G. lucidum polysaccharide has a synergistic impact, providing a theoretical basis for their potential as a combined therapeutic approach for obesity.

AB Background and aims: To date, the relationship between coffee consumption and metabolic phenotypes has hardly been investigated and remains controversial. Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study is to examine the associations between coffee consumption and metabolic phenotypes in a Japanese population. Methods and results: We analyzed the data of 26,363 subjects (aged 35-69 years) in the baseline survey of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. Coffee consumption was assessed using a questionnaire. Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) was defined according to the Joint Interim Statement Criteria of 2009, using body mass index (BMI) instead of waist circumference. Subjects stratified by the presence or absence of obesity (normal weight: BMI <25 kg/m2; obesity: BMI >= 25 kg/m2) were classified by the number of MetS components (metabolically healthy: no components; metabolically unhealthy: one or more components) other than BMI. In multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, and other potential confounders, high coffee consumption (>= 3 cups/day) was associated with a lower prevalence of MetS and metabolically unhealthy phenotypes both in normal weight (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.90) and obese subjects (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.99). Filtered/instant coffee consumption was inversely associated with the prevalence of MetS and metabolically unhealthy phenotypes, whereas canned/bottled/packed coffee consumption was not. Conclusion: The present results suggest that high coffee consumption, particularly filtered/ instant coffee, is inversely associated with the prevalence of metabolically unhealthy phenotypes in both normal weight and obese Japanese adults. 2022 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Ital-ian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

AB Many observational and clinical studies have shown that consumption of diets rich in plant polyphenols have beneficial effects on various diseases such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Animal and cellular studies have indicated that these polyphenolic compounds contribute to such effects. The representative polyphenols are epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate in tea, chlorogenic acids in coffee, resveratrol in wine, and curcumin in curry. The results of human studies have suggested the beneficial effects of consumption of these foods on NDDs including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and cellular animal experiments have provided molecular basis to indicate contribution of these representative polyphenols to these effects. This article provides updated information on the effects of these foods and their polyphenols on NDDs with discussions on mechanistic aspects of their actions mainly based on the findings derived from basic experiments.

AB Caffeic acid belongs to the polyphenol compounds we consume daily, often in the form of coffee. Even though it is less explored than caffeic acid phenethyl ester, it still has many positive effects on human health. Caffeic acid can affect cancer, diabetes, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, or bacterial and viral infections. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of how caffeic acid achieves its effects.

AB Purpose Epidemiological studies support a protective role of habitual coffee and caffeine consumption against the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to investigate the causal relationship between coffee intake and the risk of NAFLD. Methods We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using SNPs associated with habitual coffee intake in a published genome-wide association study (GWAS) as genetic instruments and summary-level data from a published GWAS of NAFLD (1122 cases and 399,900 healthy controls) in the UK Biobank. The causal relationship was estimated with the inverse weighted method using a 4-SNP and 6-SNP instrument based on the single largest non-UK Biobank GWAS (n = 91,462) and meta-analysis (n = 121,524) of GWAS data on habitual coffee intake, respectively. To maximize power, we also used up to 77 SNPs associated with coffee intake at a liberal significance level (p <= 1e-4) as instruments. Results We observed a non-significant trend towards a causal protective effect of coffee intake on NAFLD based upon either the 4-SNP (OR: 0.76; 95% CI 0.51, 1.14,p = 0.19) or 6-SNP genetic instruments (OR: 0.77; 95% CI 0.48, 1.25,p = 0.29). The result also remains non-significant when using the more liberal 77-SNP instrument. Conclusion Our findings do not support a causal relationship between coffee intake and NAFLD risk. However, despite the largest-to-date sample size, the power of this study may be limited by the non-specificity and moderate effect size of the genetic alleles on coffee intake.

AB Food industry has been investing in bringing to the market coffee-based drinks enriched in compounds that promise weight loss, which consequently influences diabetes risk. However, there are no clinical trials showing the effects of brewed coffee (with or without caffeine) enriched with bioactive compounds on body fat and glycemic control in healthy individuals. Therefore, we have evaluated the effect of consuming two coffee formulas enriched with cocoa and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on glycemic and anthropometric biomarkers and blood pressure in non-diabetic adults for 10 weeks. In general, we observed that the values of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (p = .006) and fasting capillary blood glucose (FCBG) (p < .001) had lower values with a tendency to decrease in FCG (p = .003) and FBG (p < .005) in both formulas. We observed statistically significant reductions in waist circumference (WC) (p = .012), arm circumference (AC) (p = .015), and percentage of fat (<0.0001) for all participants. However, we noticed a greater reduction in the caffeinated formula group (-2.92%, p = .005) compared to the decaffeinated formula (-1.62%, p = .008). Consumers of both cocoa and FOS-enriched coffee formulas benefited from reduced FBG, FCG, WC, and body fat percentage. The consumption of caffeinated formula was more effective in reducing the percentage of fat, while the decaffeinated formula was more effective in reducing diastolic blood pressure. Practical applications This study provides robust evidence that effects of fortified coffee on non-diabetic people is positive for reduction in blood glucose, body fat and diastolic blood pressure. This study proposes a practical and safe coffee formulation for the consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee for non-diabetic people.

AB Background : Coffee, tea, sugar -sweetened beverages (SSBs), and low- and no -calorie sweetened beverages (LNCSBs) are generally frequently consumed in the Nordic and Baltic countries. These beverages have also been related to potential health effects. This scoping review describes the evidence for the role of coffee, tea, SSBs, and LNCSBs for health -related outcomes as a basis for setting and updating food -based dietary guidelines. We used evidence from several qualified systematic reviews (i.e. World Cancer Research Fund, US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, European Food Safety Authority, and World Health Organization) and performed a search for additional systematic reviews. The evidence suggests that moderate coffee and tea consumption do not have long-term adverse health effects. The long-term favorable effects of coffee consumption are related to reduced risk of endometrial and liver cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular deaths. However, results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that coffee brews that are rich in diterpenes, such as boiled coffee, increase serum cholesterol concentrations. High caffeine intake in pregnancy is associated with higher risk of pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and low birth weight. High consumption of SSBs has been associated with increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, based on data from RCTs and prospective cohort studies. The consumption of LNCSBs may result in a small reduction in body weight in adults, likely mediated through the effect of reduced energy intake, but has neutral effects on other cardiometabolic risk markers using evidence from RCTs. However, evidence from observational studies indicates increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases among high LNCSB consumers. In conclusion, current evidence suggests that moderate coffee and tea consumption have no long-term adverse health effects. The evidence of beneficial effects of coffee consumption on liver and endometrial cancer risk, and some cardiovascular outcomes, comes from observational studies. High consumption of boiled coffee should be avoided due to negative effect on lipid profile. Pregnant women should not exceed the recommended daily dose of caffeine intake of 200 mg set by the European Food Safety Authority as a safe level for the fetus. High consumption of SSBs has consistently been associated with adverse health effects, which is mainly due to excess energy intake, and should be limited. The conflicting results from RCTs and observational studies regarding LNCSBs may be due to revere causation and should be explored further.

AB Background: Studies about the association of carbonated/soft drinks, coffee, and tea with depression and anxiety are scarce and inconclusive and little is known about this association in European adults. Our aim was to examine the association between the consumption of these beverages and depressive and anxiety symptom severity. Methods: A total of 941 European overweight adults (mean age, 46.8 years) with subsyndromal depression that participated in the MooDFOOD depression prevention randomized controlled trial (Clinical Trials.gov identifier: NCT2529423; date of the study: from 2014 to 2018) were analyzed. Depressive and anxiety symptom severity and beverage consumption were assessed using multilevel mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models for each beverage consumption (carbonated/soft drink with sugar, carbonated/soft drink with non-nutritive sweeteners, coffee, and tea) with the three repeated measures of follow-up (baseline and 6 and 12 months). A case report form for participants' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, the Food Frequency Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale, the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0, the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing Psychical Activity, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test were the research tools used. Results: Daily consumption of carbonated/soft drinks with sugar was associated with a higher level of anxiety. Trends towards significance were found for associations between both daily consumption of carbonated/soft drinks with sugar and non-nutritive sweeteners and a higher level of depression. No relationship was found between coffee and tea consumption and the level of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: The high and regular consumption of carbonated/soft drink with sugar (amount of consumption: & GE;1 unit (200 mL)/day) tended to be associated with higher level of anxiety in a multicountry sample of overweight subjects with subsyndromal depressive symptoms. It is important to point out that further research in this area is essential to provide valuable information about the intake patterns of non-alcoholic beverages and their relationship with affective disorders in the European adult population.

AB Dietary intake of caffeine has significantly increased in recent years, and beneficial and harmful effects of caffeine have been extensively studied. This paper reviews antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of caffeine as well as its protective effects on cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, cancers, and neurodegenerative and liver diseases. In addition, we summarize the side effects of long-term or excessive caffeine consumption on sleep, migraine, intraocular pressure, pregnant women, children, and adolescents. The health benefits of caffeine depend on the amount of caffeine intake and the physical condition of consumers. Moderate intake of caffeine helps to prevent and modulate several diseases. However, the long-term or over-consumption of caffeine can lead to addiction, insomnia, migraine, and other side effects. In addition, children, adolescents, pregnant women, and people who are sensitive to caffeine should be recommended to restrict/reduce their intake to avoid potential adverse effects.

AB Obesity, a major public health problem, causes numerous complications that threaten human health and increase the socioeconomic burden. The pathophysiology of obesity is primarily attributed to lipid metabolism disorders. Conventional anti -obesity medications have a high abuse potential and frequently deliver insufficient efficacy and have negative side -effects. Hence, functional foods are regarded as effective alternatives to address obesity. Coffee, tea, and cocoa, three widely consumed beverages, have long been considered to have the potential to prevent obesity, and several studies have focused on their intrinsic molecular mechanisms in past few years. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which the bioactive ingredients in these three beverages counteract obesity from the aspects of adipogenesis, lipolysis, and energy expenditure (thermogenesis). The future prospects and challenges for coffee, tea, and cocoa as functional products for the treatment of obesity are also discussed, which can be pursued for future drug development and prevention strategies against obesity.

AB We aimed at quantifying the effects of different tea and coffee on weight loss in adults. We searched PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL and grey literature sources to July 2024. The study excluded cross-over trials without washout period, those in critically ill patients, pregnant or breast-feeding women, multicomponent interventions and active control groups with tea or coffee. A random-effects network meta-analysis with a Bayesian framework was performed to calculate the mean difference (MD) and 95 % credible intervals (CrIs). The certainty of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane tool. Twenty-two randomised controlled trials with 1710 participants (average intervention duration = 10 weeks) were included. Green tea was effective for weight loss compared with placebo (MD: -1<middle dot>23 kg, 95 % CrI: -2<middle dot>45, -0<middle dot>02; low certainty evidence) or water (MD: -1<middle dot>61 kg, 95 % CrI: -2<middle dot>90, -0<middle dot>35; very low certainty evidence), while other beverages (coffee, decaffeinated coffee, green coffee, black tea and sour tea) were not. Green tea was effective for weight loss compared with water in sensitivity analysis of healthy individuals (MD: -3<middle dot>31 kg, 95 % CrI: -5<middle dot>83, -1<middle dot>04). Based on very low to low certainty evidence, green tea drinking may result in a small weight loss in adults. This study mainly focused on weight loss effects of green tea and coffee, with limited data on other teas. Only five trials had longer intervention durations, suggesting future research on long-term effects. Most trials had high bias risk and low certainty, requiring more high-quality trials.

AB Hypericum perforatum transformed shoot lines (TSL) regenerated from corresponding hairy roots and non-transformed shoots (NTS) were comparatively evaluated for their phenolic compound contents and in vitro inhibitory capacity against target enzymes (monoamine oxidase-A, cholinesterases, tyrosinase, alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, lipase, and cholesterol esterase). Molecular docking was conducted to assess the contribution of dominant phenolic compounds to the enzyme-inhibitory properties of TSL samples. The TSL extracts represent a rich source of chlorogenic acid, epicatechin and procyanidins, quercetin aglycone and glycosides, anthocyanins, naphthodianthrones, acyl-phloroglucinols, and xanthones. Concerning in vitro bioactivity assays, TSL displayed significantly higher acetylcholinesterase, tyrosinase, alpha-amylase, pancreatic lipase, and cholesterol esterase inhibitory properties compared to NTS, implying their neuroprotective, antidiabetic, and antiobesity potential. The docking data revealed that pseudohypericin, hyperforin, cadensin G, epicatechin, and chlorogenic acid are superior inhibitors of selected enzymes, exhibiting the lowest binding energy of ligand-receptor complexes. Present data indicate that H. perforatum transformed shoots might be recognized as an excellent biotechnological system for producing phenolic compounds with multiple health benefits.

AB Knowledge on the bioavailability of coffee (poly)phenols mostly come from single dose postprandial studies. This study aimed at investigating the effects of regularly consuming a green coffee phenolic extract (GCPE) on the bioavailability and metabolism of (poly)phenols. Volunteers with overweight/obesity consumed a decaffeinated GCPE nutraceutical containing 300 mg hydroxycinnamates twice daily for two months. Plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics, and fecal excretion of phenolic metabolites were characterized by LC-MS-QToF at weeks 0 and 8. Fifty-four metabolites were identified in biological fluids. Regular consumption of the nutraceutical produced certain changes: reduced forms of caffeic, ferulic and coumaric acids in urine or 3-(3 '-hydroxypenyl)propanoic, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids in feces significantly increased (p < 0.05) after 8 weeks; in contrast, coumaroylquinic and dihydrocoumaroylquinic acids in urine decreased (p < 0.05) compared to baseline excretion. The sum of intestinal and colonic metabolites increased after sustained consumption of GCPE, without reaching statistical significance, suggesting a small overall effect on (poly)phenols' bioavailability.

Leptin, adiponectin, spexin, malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity. Liver tissue oxidative stress (catalase, super oxide dismutase and glutathione) and inflammation (IL-1 & beta; and IL-6) markers were assessed for green coffee and its mixture with green tea. Results revealed improvement of all parameters upon treatments with more prominence for those treated with green caffeinated extract (coffee and tea) especially in mixture. Upon comparing with obese rat group, the green mixture of coffee and tea exhibited anti-hyperlipidemic action through lowering serum triglycerides by 35.0% and elevating high density lipoprotein by 71.0%. Black tea was likewise effective in lowering serum cholesterol and low density lipoprotein by 28.0 and 50.6%, respectively. GC-MS- based metabolomics of rat serum led to the identification of 34 metabolites with obese rat serum enriched in fatty acids (oleamide).

AB Low-grade chronic inflammation is associated with many chronic diseases and pathological conditions. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of regular caffeine intake, physical activity levels, and sedentary behavior on the inflammatory status in healthy participants. In total, 112 men and 132 women aged 18 to 55 years and belonging to the staff and student population of the University of the Balearic Islands volunteered to participate in this descriptive cross-sectional study. Plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers were measured. Weight, height, and body composition (bioelectrical impedance) were determined. Caffeine intake, physical activity levels and sitting time, and diet quality were determined using questionnaires. Statistical regression analysis showed that caffeine intake was a negative predictor of C-reactive protein (CRP) (p= 0.001). Body fat percentage was positively associated with CRP (p< 0.001) and inversely associated with adiponectin (p= 0.032) and interleukin (IL)-10 levels (p= 0.001). Visceral fat was the main predictor for IL-6 (p< 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (p< 0.001). Sitting time was found to be the main, inverse, predictor for IL-10 (p< 0.001), and a positive predictor for TNF-alpha (p< 0.001). In conclusion, regular caffeine consumption induced very limited anti-inflammatory effects. Sedentary behavior and body fat accumulation induced significant pro-inflammatory effects.

AB Coffee presents beneficial health properties, including antiobesity effects. However, its effects on inflammation are controversial. Hydroxycinnamic acids are the main coffee phenolic bioactive compounds. In human bioavailability studies carried out with coffee, among the most abundant compounds found in urine and plasma were the colonic metabolites, dihydrocaffeic (DHCA), dihydroferulic (DHFA), and hydroxyhippuric (HHA) acids. To understand the hepato-protective potential of these three compounds, we tested whether treatment with realistic concentrations (0.5-10 mu M) were effective to counteract inflammatory process and oxidative status induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). First, we established a novel model of inflammation/oxidation using TNF-alpha and HepG2 cells. Afterwards, we evaluated the activity of DHCA, DHFA, and HHA against the inflammatory/oxidative challenge through the determination of the inflammatory mediators, interleukins (IL)-6, and IL-8 and chemokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1, as well as the levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress, such as reactive oxygen species, reduced glutathione, and the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and reductase. Results showed that all three compounds have a potential hepato-protective effect against the induced inflammatory/oxidative insult.

AB Background. Obesity is considered a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Different components of the diet, like antioxidants, can have anti-inflammatory effects or cause chronic inflammation. This study investigated the dietary TAC and inflammatory markers and body composition in obese and overweight women. Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 259 women with overweight and obesity. Dietary intake was assessed by using an FFQ with 147 items, and DTAC was used to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of the diet. The anthropometric measurements, body composition, and biochemical assessments were measured by standard protocols. Results. We observed a significant positive association between DTAC and consumption of fruits (P = 0.021), vegetable oils (P < 0.001), potassium (P = 0.006), manganese (P = 0.003), and caffeine (P < 0.001), after adjusting confounders. After adjusting for age, energy intake, and physical activity, there was a significant correlation between DTAC and fat-free mass (FFM) (P:0.054), fat-free mass index (FFMI) (P:0.012), waist circumference (WC) (P:0.002), and visceral fat level (VFL) (P:0.063). FFM, FFMI, waist circumference (WC), and visceral fat area (VFA) were mediated by IL-1 beta. FFM, VFL, VFA, and WC were mediated by PAI-1. Conclusion. Some anthropometric indices were associated with DTAC, mediated by augmenting serum levels of IL-1 beta and PAI-1. Intake of foods rich in antioxidants could represent a protective strategy against chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease.

AB This study assessed the association between sarcopenic obesity (S+O+) and coffee intake inelderly Koreans. This study obtained data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES, 2008-2011), a cross-sectional and nationally representative survey conducted by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the 2,661 participants included in this study, there was a significant difference between 5.861 (95% CI 2.024-16.971) in less than one cup of coffee, and 6.245 (95% CI 2.136-18.260) in one cup of coffee, and 4.323 (95% CI 1.457-12.824) in two cups of coffee compared to three or more than cups of coffee. In contrast, in the case of sarcopenia or obesity only (S+O- or S-O+), no significant difference was found in any model. The results suggest that the elderly who consume less than one cup of coffee per day had a greater risk of S+O+ than those who consume more than three cups per day. Furthermore, there was an association between coffee intake and sarcopenia but not with obesity. Therefore, coffee intake may have prevented musculoskeletal loss in these patients.

AB Context Resting heart rate (HR) is increasingly recognized as an indicator of disease and overall morbidity and mortality. Whether chronic coffee consumption affects resting HR is an important consideration for individual consumers as well as from a public health perspective.Objective A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to examine the effectiveness of coffee consumption on resting HR.Data Sources Original RCTs assessing the effect of coffee consumption on resting HR and published prior to March 2023 were identified by searching online databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases.Data Extraction and Analysis Data searches and extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were performed according to the Cochrane guidelines, and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. Data on study characteristics, type, and amount of coffee and net change and measurement resting HR were extracted. A random-effects or a fixed-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect sizes. Homogeneity was determined with the Cochran Q test, and publication bias was assessed through Begg's test, Egger's test, and funnel plots.Results A total of 6 RCTs with 11 intervention trials or arms involving 485 individuals were included. The participants were generally healthy, although some had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or were overweight. The trial duration ranged from 2 weeks to 24 weeks. The overall pooled analysis showed that coffee consumption resulted in a negligible increase in resting HR of 0.40 beats per minute (95% CI: -0.78 to 1.57; P = 0.506), which was statistically insignificant. Subgroup analysis of all specified categories was consistent with the overall analysis. No heterogeneity was observed among included trials (I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.756).Conclusion The results of the present meta-analysis study demonstrate that daily coffee consumption of 3 to 6 cups for a period of 2 to 24 weeks has no statistically significant effect on resting HR.

AB Background: In observational studies, coffee consumption has been consistently associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Trials examining the effect of coffee consumption on glucose metabolism have been limited by the use of surrogate insulin sensitivity indices, small sample sizes, lack of blinding, and short follow-up duration.
   Objectives: We aimed to overcome limitations of previously conducted coffee trials in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of the effect of coffee consumption on insulin sensitivity.
   Methods: We conducted a 24-wk randomized placebo-controlled trial in 126 overweight, non-insulin sensitive (HOMA-IR >= 1.30), Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indian males and females aged 35-69 y. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 4 cups of instant regular coffee (n = 62) or 4 cups of a coffee-like placebo beverage (n = 64) per day. The primary outcome was the amount of glucose metabolized per kilogram of body weight per minute (Mbw) assessed during steady-state conditions with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Secondary outcomes included other clamp-based insulin sensitivity measures, biological mediators of insulin sensitivity, and measures of fasting glucose metabolism.
   Results: Coffee consumption did not significantly change insulin sensitivity compared with placebo (percentage mean difference in Mbw = 4.0%; 95% CI: -8.3, 18.0%; P = 0.53). Furthermore, no significant differences in fasting plasma glucose (2.9%; 95% CI: -0.4, 6.3%; P = 0.09) or biological mediators of insulin resistance, such as plasma adiponectin (2.3%; 95% CI: -1.4, 6.2%; P = 0.22), were observed between coffee and placebo groups over 24 wk of intervention. Participants in the coffee arm experienced a loss of fat mass (FM) (-3.7%; 95% CI: -6.3, -1.1%; P = 0.006) and reduction in urinary creatinine concentrations (-21.2%; 95% CI: -31.4,-9.5%; P= 0.001) comparedwith participants in the placebo arm over 24 wk of intervention.
   Conclusions: Consuming 4 cups/d of caffeinated coffee for 24 wk had no significant effect on insulin sensitivity or biological mediators of insulin resistance but was associated with a modest loss of FM and reduction in urinary creatinine concentrations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01738399. Registered on November 28, 2012. Trial sponsor: Nestle Research, Lausanne, Switzerland. Trial site: National University of Singapore.

AB Coffee peel (CP) contains abundant phytochemicals which might prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present study aimed to identify the main phytochemicals in CP extracts, and to investigate whether CP extracts could ameliorate NAFLD through a hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21-adiponectin signaling pathway. Caffeine and seven monomers of flavonoids were identified from CP extracts by using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). After 8 weeks of intervention, the mice fed a high-fat and high-sugar diet showed the pathophysiological characteristics of NAFLD. Treatment with CP extracts significantly alleviated hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance and reduced the concentrations of serum alanine transaminase, FGF21, and triglyceride, and hepatic interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while increasing serum adiponectin concentrations. Meanwhile, CP extract supplementation significantly decreased the gene and protein expression levels of FGF21, while enhancing adiponectin expression levels. The present study demonstrated that CP extracts contained caffeine and seven monomers of flavonoids, and protected against NAFLD through regulating the FGF21-adiponectin signaling pathway.

AB Objective This study aimed to investigate the potential antiobesity benefits of hot tea consumption at the population level. Methods Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006, the association between hot tea consumption and dual-energy x-ray-measured body fat was examined in a large representative sample of US adults (n = 5,681, 51.9% women). Results Compared with non-tea drinkers, men who consumed 0.25 to 1 cup per day of hot tea had 1.5% (95% CI: 0.4% to 2.6%) and 1.7% (95% CI: 0.4% to 3.0%) less total and trunk body fat, respectively. The associations were stronger among men 45 to 69 years old compared with younger men (20-44 years). For men who consumed 1 or more cups per day of hot tea, lower total (-1.2%, 95% CI: -2.3% to -0.2%) and trunk body fat (-1.3%, 95% CI: -2.6 to -0.1%) was observed among men 45 to 69 years old only. In women, those who drank 1 or more cups per day had 1.5% lower (95% CI: -2.7% to -0.3%) trunk body fat compared with non-tea drinkers. Conclusions Consumption of hot tea might be considered as part of a healthy diet in order to support parameters associated with metabolic health and may be particularly important in older male age groups in supporting reduced central adiposity.

AB Though ubiquitous in nature, polyphenols gained scientific prominence only after the pioneering work of researchers like E. Fischer and K. Freudenberg, who demonstrated their potential beyond traditional applications, such as in the leather industry. Today, these bioactive compounds are recognized for their diverse therapeutic roles, including their use as adjuvants in cancer treatment, cancer prevention, and their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Additionally, polyphenols have demonstrated benefits in managing obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and neuromodulation. Their synthesis is influenced by environmental and genetic factors, with their concentrations varying based on the intensity of these variables, as well as the stage of ripening. This review provides a comprehensive overview of polyphenols, covering their classification, chemical structures, and bioavailability. The mechanisms influencing bioavailability, bioaccessibility, and bioactivity are explored in detail, alongside an introduction to their bioactive effects and associated metabolic pathways. Specific examples, such as the bioavailability of polyphenols in coffee and various types of onions, are analyzed. Despite their promising biological activities, a significant limitation of polyphenols lies in their inherently low oral bioavailability. However, their systemic circulation and the bioactive by-products formed during digestion present exciting opportunities for further research and application.

AB Background and aims The Healthy Beverage Index (HBI) is a valuable technique to estimate the synergistic effects of overall beverage consumption. Several studies have evaluated the associations between HBI and beneficial changes in the health status. however, there is no study on the association between patterns of beverage consumption and mental health status. Therefore, this study sought to examine the association between HBI and psychological disorders among overweight and obese women. Methods 199 overweight and obese women, between the ages of 18 and 55 y, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study in Tehran, Iran. To collect beverage dietary data, a validated semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used. Furthermore, the DASS-21 questionnaire was used to assess psychological profile states. Results The association of total depression anxiety stress (DASS) score with healthy beverage index (HBI) tertiles in models was marginally significant (OR =: 0.78; 95% CI 0.30-2.02; P-value = 0.074; (OR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.28-2.16; P-value = 0.062), respectively. In terms of stress, anxiety, and depression, after adjusting for confounders, participants with higher HBI in the third tertile had lower odds of depression vs. the first tertile (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.35-2.81; P-trend = 0.040). Conclusion We demonstrate that the total DASS score was associated with HBI tertiles. We also found that participants with higher HBI had lower odds of depression. However, additional well-designed studies are needed to confirm the veracity of these findings.

AB Purpose Excessive fat mass accumulation in obesity leads to diverse metabolic disorders, increased risks of cardiovascular diseases and in some cases, mortality. The aim of this study was to screen the actions of botanical extracts intended for oral use on human adipose tissue, using an in vitro screening model combining human intestinal cells with human adipose cells. This was to find the most effective extracts on lipid accumulation, UCP1 expression and ATP production in pre-adipocytes and on adipocyte lipolysis. Methods In this study, 25 individual plant extracts were screened for their effects on human adipose cells. Consequently, an original in vitro model was set up using the Caco-2 cell line, to mimic the intestinal passage of the extracts and then exposing human adipose cells to them. The biological actions of extracts were thus characterized, and compared with a coffee extract standard. The most effective extracts, and their combinations, were retained for their actions on lipid accumulation, the expression of the thermogenic effector UCP1 and ATP production in pre-adipocytes as well as on lipolysis activity of mature adipocytes. Results The biphasic culture system combining human Caco-2 cells with human adipose cells was verified as functional using the green coffee extract standard. Out of the 25 plant extracts studied, only 7 and their combinations were retained due to their potent effects on adipose cells biology. The data showed that compared to the coffee extract standard, Immortelle, Catechu, Carrot and Rose hip extracts were the most effective in reducing lipid accumulation and increased UCP1 expression in human pre-adipocytes. Conclusion This study reveals the potential inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation and thermogenic activity of Immortelle, Catechu, Carrot and Rose hip extracts, and for the first time synergies in their combinations, using an in vitro model mimicking as closely as possible, human intestinal passage linked to adipose cells. These findings need to be confirmed by in vivo trials.

AB Energy drinks containing significant quantities of caffeine, taurine and sugar are increasingly consumed, particularly by adolescents and young adults. The putative effects of chronic ingestion of either standard energy drink, Mother(TM) (ED), or its sugar-free formulation (sfED) on metabolic syndrome were determined in wild-type C57BL/6J mice, in comparison to a soft drink, Coca-Cola (SD), a Western-styled diet enriched in saturated fatty acids (SFA), and a combination of SFA + ED. Following 13 weeks of intervention, mice treated with ED were hyperglycaemic and hypertriglyceridaemic, indicating higher triglyceride glucose index, which was similar to the mice maintained on SD. Surprisingly, the mice maintained on sfED also showed signs of insulin resistance with hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and greater triglyceride glucose index, comparable to the ED group mice. In addition, the ED mice had greater adiposity primarily due to the increase in white adipose tissue, although the body weight was comparable to the control mice receiving only water. The mice maintained on SFA diet exhibited significantly greater weight gain, body fat, cholesterol and insulin, whilst blood glucose and triglyceride concentrations remained comparable to the control mice. Collectively, these data suggest that the consumption of both standard and sugar-free forms of energy drinks induces metabolic syndrome, particularly insulin resistance.

AB Apple pomace flour (APF) obtained at industrial scale level by the application of innovative technological process (dehydration (5 h, T <= 55 degrees C), grinding (300 mu m)) was evaluated as a source of bioactive compounds with antioxidative, antiobesity and antidiabetic effects. Proximate composition, individual (HPLC-DAD-MS/MS) and total phenols (TPC) as well as flavonoids content (TFC), antioxidant (AO) activity (DPPH, ABTS, HPMC), water and oil holding capacity (WHC and OHC) of APFs obtained from apple pomace from mixed and individual apple cultivars grown conventionally and organically were compared. The effect of APF supplementation on the glycaemic status and glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) of C57BL/6J mice exposed to high-fat and sucrose diet was examined. High K content (4.2-6.4 g/kg), dietary fibres (35-45 g/100 g), TPC (4.6-8.1 mg GAE/g), TFC (18.6-34.6 mg QE/g), high water and oil holding capacity (4.7-6.4 and 1.3-1.6 g/g) were observed in the APFs. Content of major phenols (phlorizin, chlorogenic acid, quercetin), TPC and TFC correlated highly with prominent AO activity. APF supplementation lowered the increase of body weight gain and blood glucose, and improved glucose tolerance significantly. Health-promoting biomolecules, AO activity, functional properties and prevention of diet-driven glucose metabolism disorders pave the way to APF exploitation in human nutrition.

AB We evaluated the effects of acute intake of biscuits (B) containing either spent coffee grounds (SCG), (added with fructooligosaccharides; SC-FOS) or SCG antioxidant dietary fiber (SCF), on satiety, energy intake as well as gastrointestinal tolerance of healthy overweight volunteers. The addition of SCG and SCF to the biscuits (SC-FOS-B and SCF-B) increased their protein (11.4% and 12.2%), and total dietary fiber (8.4% and 11.8%) contents. The SCF-B significantly increased satiety perception, impacting ad libitum energy intake compared to the traditional biscuits recipe (TB; no added fiber). Moreover, SC-FOS-B and SCF-B decreased (no-observed-adverse effect) the most frequently reported symptoms by the participants, demonstrating that doses up to 5 g of SCF (per biscuit portion; 45 g) are well tolerated. The use of SCF and SCG as functional ingredients represents a sustainable strategy for the coffee industry and also potentiates the reduction of overweight, one of the leading health problems among the population.
   Practical applications The addition of SCF or SCG as food ingredients increases protein and the dietary fiber content of traditional biscuits. SCF can slow gastric emptying, modulate appetite and thus body weight. SCF attenuates carbohydrate digestion blunting post-prandial blood glucose spikes reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. SCF can be used as a functional ingredient to formulate foods with health benefits.

AB Many in vitro and in vivo studies support that green coffee polyphenols (GCP) and beta-glucans (BG) present important hypolipidaemic and hypoglycaemic effects. However, their weight-management/-reducing properties are less clear. Considering that these compounds act on different metabolic pathways, their combination could increase their beneficial health effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of regularly consuming supplements containing GCP, BG or the novel GCP/BG combination on body composition in overweight/obese subjects without changing their dietary and physical activity habits, hence addressing the difficulty to adapt to lifestyle changes. A randomised, cross-over, blind trial was carried out in 29 volunteers who consumed GCP (300 mg), BG (2.5 g) or GCP/BG (300 mg + 2.5 g) twice a day for 8 weeks. At the beginning and end of each of the interventions, body weight, body mass index, body fat%, intracellular and extracellular water, skinfolds (tricipital, bicipital, subscapularis, suprailiac, leg and thigh) and body circumferences (waist, hip, thigh, calf, branchial) were measured. Along the study, volunteers filled out 72 h dietary records, and physical activity was measured using accelerometers. The results show that dietary intake and physical activity were unchanged throughout the study; however, there were no changes in any of the body composition parameters analysed with any of the food supplements. In conclusion, the regular intake of GCP, BG and GCP/BG, without changes in diet and physical activity, is not an efficient strategy to lose weight or induce other positive changes in body composition, although results should be taken with caution as the study was underpowered.

AB Artichoke has been used for a long time in the traditional medicine against dyspeptic complaints and as a liver protector due to its choleretic and cholagogue effects. Chlorogenic acid, the main ingredient of artichoke is known to show hepatoprotector, anticancer, anti-obesity and antioxidant activities. In this study, antioxidant activity and chlorogenic acid quantification were performed using the samples of artichoke as fresh, boiled, frozen, boiled frozen, canned, fresh leaf and dry leaf. Potential antioxidant activity was evaluated using DPPH assay. Flavonoid and phenolic contents were determined by Aluminum chloride colorimetry and Folin-Ciocalteu methods. The amounts of colorogenic acid in the samples were determined by HPLC-DAD system. The results have shown that highest chlorogenic acid content was determined in the 10-minute frozen-boiled sample (0.01441 mg/100g), followed by canned (0.01043 mg/100g), 20-minute cooked artichoke (0.001912 mg/100g), fresh artichoke (0.001519 mg/100g) and frozen artichoke (0.0004 mg/100g). The antioxidant activity results have revealed that highest % DPPH capture effect was observed in the cooked artichoke sample (ED50 =1.949 mg/ml). The total flavonoid content was equivalent to quercetin (43.859 mg QE/100g) whereas total phenolic content equalled to gallic acid (14.640 mg GAE/100g). The antioxidant activity and the amounts of colorogenic acid were found to be the highest in the cooked artichoke sample whereas the lowest antioxidant activity observed in canned artichoke. The results show that the heat treatment applied for storage can positively affect the amount of chlorogenic acid and antioxidant activity.

AB Nutraceuticals based on plant extracts rich in polyphenols, as well as dietary fibres, are new means to fight overweight/obesity and associated diseases. However, to understand the potential effects of polyphenols on health it is critical to study their bioavailability and metabolic fate. Consumption of a green coffee phenolic extract (GCPE) in combination with oat beta-glucan (BG) could affect the pharmacokinetic profile of the main polyphenols present in coffee (hydroxycinnamates). Moreover, the regular intake of the combination could also induce changes. Nine overweight men and women consumed a novel nutraceutical product containing 300 mg of green coffee hydroxycinnamic acids and 2.5 g of BG twice a day for 8 weeks. A pharmacokinetic study was carried out in blood and urine samples taken before (baseline) and at week 8 after the nutraceutical intervention, collecting samples at different times in a 0-24 h interval. Faecal samples were also obtained at 0 and 24 h after the intake of the nutraceutical at baseline and week 8. Phenolic metabolites were analysed by LC-MS-QToF. Results showed that polyphenols were differentially absorbed and extensively metabolized throughout the gastrointestinal tract. An apparent reduction in the excretion of small intestinal metabolites was accompanied by a tendency to increase colonic metabolites after sustained intake (p = 0.052). In conclusion, continued consumption of the GCPE/BG nutraceutical appears to enhance the absorption of hydroxycinnamates by increasing the colonic bioavailability of their derived metabolites compared to baseline, although the regular intake of the nutraceutical did not modify the metabolite profile in any of the biological samples.

AB Scope Coffee and tea are among the most popular beverages in the world. However, the association between habitual coffee, green tea, and black tea consumption with metabolomics profiles in Asian populations remain largely unknown.
   Methods and Results 158 metabolites (14 amino acids, 45 acylcarnitines, and 99 sphingolipids) in the blood plasma of participants are measured from the population-based Singapore Prospective Study Program cohort using mass spectrometry (MS). Linear regression models are used to obtain the estimates for the association between coffee and tea consumption with metabolite levels, adjusted for potential confounders and false discovery rate (FDR). Coffee consumption is significantly associated with higher levels of 63 sphingolipids (29 sphingomyelins, 32 ceramides, a sphingosine-1-phosphate, and a sphingosine) and lower levels of 13 acylcarnitines and alanine. Black tea consumption is significantly associated with higher levels of eight sphingolipids, and lower levels of an amino acid, whereas green tea is significantly inversely associated with four metabolites (C8:1-OH acylcarnitine, ganglioside GM3 d18:1/16:0, sphingomyelins d18:2/18:0 and d18:1/14:0).
   Conclusions Coffee, black tea, and green tea consumption are associated with plasma levels of certain classes of sphingolipids and acylcarnitines in an Asian population, particularly sphingomyelins, which may mediate the health benefits of these beverages.

AB Objective To evaluate the variations between 2008 and 2018 in the consumption of beverages by Brazilian adults per their weight status. Methods This panel study analyzed data from two National Food Surveys referring to the adult population (20-59 years of age) (2008-2008: n=21,003; 2017-2018: n=28,153), with data from food consumption obtained by one food record day and one 24-hour recall day, respectively. The drinks were grouped into 11 groups, for which we estimated the reporting proportion (%), daily means of ingested volume (mL), and contribution (%) to daily energy intake. We assessed weight status by Body Mass Index in not overweight, overweight, and obese. Results No differences were observed in the proportion of adults who reported consuming a drink (98.5% vs. 98.3%) during the period evaluated. However, the mean daily volume (631.9mL vs. 535.1mL) and the caloric contribution of drinks (17.7% vs. 13.6%) decreased. The drinks most cited in both surveys were coffee, fruit juices, and soft drinks. Not overweight and overweight individuals showed a reduction in the reported and mean volume consumed of coffee, soft drinks, milk, dairy drinks, and processed refreshments/juices. We observed a decline in the reported consumption and volume consumed of soft drinks and milk in obese individuals. Conclusion We identified decreased reporting, mean volume, and mean caloric contribution of drinks in general in the Brazilian adult population over the 10-year period between the two surveys.

AB Aronia berry (black chokeberry) is a shrub native to North America, of which the fresh fruits are used in the food industry to produce different types of dietary products. The fruits of Aronia melanocarpa (Aronia berries) have been found to show multiple bioactivities potentially beneficial to human health, including antidiabetic, anti-infective, antineoplastic, antiobesity, and antioxidant activities, as well as heart-, liver-, and neuroprotective effects. Thus far, phenolic compounds, such as anthocyanins, cyanidins, phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins, triterpenoids, and their analogues have been identified as the major active components of Aronia berries. These natural products possess potent antioxidant activity, which contributes to the majority of the other bioactivities observed for Aronia berries. The chemical components and the potential pharmaceutical or health-promoting effects of Aronia berries have been summarized previously. The present review article focuses on the molecular targets of extracts of Aronia berries and the examples of promising lead compounds isolated from these berries, including cyanidin-3-O-galactoside, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and ursolic acid. In addition, presented herein are clinical trial investigations for Aronia berries and their major components, including cancer clinical trials for chlorogenic acid and COVID-19 trial studies for quercetin. Additionally, the possible development of Aronia berries and their secondary metabolites as potential therapeutic agents is discussed. It is hoped that this contribution will help stimulate future investigations on Aronia berries for the continual improvement of human health.

AB Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coffee intake in US-based 23andMe participants (N = 130,153) and identified 7 significant loci, with many replicating in three multi-ancestral cohorts. We examined genetic correlations and performed a phenome-wide association study across hundreds of biomarkers, health, and lifestyle traits, then compared our results to the largest available GWAS of coffee intake from the UK Biobank (UKB; N = 334,659). We observed consistent positive genetic correlations with substance use and obesity in both cohorts. Other genetic correlations were discrepant, including positive genetic correlations between coffee intake and psychiatric illnesses, pain, and gastrointestinal traits in 23andMe that were absent or negative in the UKB, and genetic correlations with cognition that were negative in 23andMe but positive in the UKB. Phenome-wide association study using polygenic scores of coffee intake derived from 23andMe or UKB summary statistics also revealed consistent associations with increased odds of obesity- and red blood cell-related traits, but all other associations were cohort-specific. Our study shows that the genetics of coffee intake associate with substance use and obesity across cohorts, but also that GWAS performed in different populations could capture cultural differences in the relationship between behavior and genetics.

AB We assessed the association between usual coffee consumption and all-cause, cardiovascular (CV), and cancer mortality in an adult population in Spain, taking into account both the amount and type of coffee consumed. We used baseline data on coffee consumption and other personal variables, and the number of deaths during an 18-year follow-up period, for 1567 participants aged 20 years and older from the Valencia Nutrition Study in Spain. Total, caffeinated, and decaffeinated coffee consumption was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During the 18-year follow-up period, 317 died; 115 due to CV disease and 82 due to cancer. Compared with no-consumption, the consumption of <= 1 cup per day and >1 cup per day of coffee was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, HR = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56-0.97) and HR 0.56 (95% CI: 0.41-0.77), respectively. A lower cancer mortality was observed among drinkers of more than 1 cup per day compared with nondrinkers, HR 0.41 (95% CI 0.20-0.86). Regarding the type of coffee, only the overall consumption of caffeinated coffee was associated with lower all-cause mortality at 12 and 18 years of follow-up, HR = 0.66 (95% CI:0.46-0.94) and HR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.44-0.79), respectively. In conclusion, this study suggests that the moderate consumption of coffee, particularly caffeinated coffee (range 1-6.5 cups per day), is associated with a lower all-cause and cancer mortality after a long follow-up period. No significant association was found between coffee consumption and CVD mortality.

AB Intestinal glucose absorption plays a central role in the regulation of glucose plasmatic; however, current clinical management does not target the gut for treating diabetes. This study evaluated the effects of peel and pulp aqueous extract from Hylocereus lemairei on human enterocytes under high glucose concentration. Anti-hyperglycemic and antiobesity activities in vitro were also evaluated. Extracts did not cause cytotoxicity at 1 to 500 mu g/mL. Moreover, they were effective in attenuating oxidative stress (DCFH-DA assay) and inflammation ((ON)-O-center dot production) caused by high glucose. Intestinal enzymes (alpha- glucosidase and pancreatic lipase) were inhibited by pulp and peel extracts (>60% and >95%, respectively). Extracts exhibited a redox capacity superior to ascorbic and chlorogenic acids, presenting high phenolic content, mainly anthocyanins. The main compounds for both extracts were chlorogenic acid and naringin, and peel stood both qualitatively and quantitatively. Data suggest red Pitaya has potential as a new medicine for diabetes.

AB Introduction: Chronic caffeine administration prevents postprandial glucose disturbance in rats. The increase in caffeine consumption is not debatable, this is how his research has become extensive in his different fields. Objective. To analyze the effects of chronic administration of caffeine in rats fed a cafeteria diet, by evaluating consumption, anthropometric and biochemical indices. Previous studies refer to administering caffeine in diets high in carbohydrates and / or in fat that induce obesity or symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Material and methods. The cafeteria diet is a dietary model equivalent to the characteristics of the typical western diet that causes metabolic syndrome in humans. In this research, chronic intraperitoneal administration of caffeine was performed for 8 weeks to adult male Wistar rats fed a cafeteria diet. Given the little evidence about the biological and behavioral effects of the chronic administration of this substance against a cafeteria diet model, consumption, anthropometric and biochemical parameters were evaluated. Results. After eight weeks it was found that the cafeteria diet given to the controls caused abnormalities associated with the metabolic syndrome; regarding the administration of caffeine in the rats fed this diet, the treatment turned out to be a protective factor in postprandial glucose, but not in the alteration of glucose tolerance or lipid profile. Conclusions. Caffeine allowed to protect postprandial glucose levels at the end of the experiment and a decrease in body weight and food consumption only in the first week. However, no significant improvements were seen in lipid profile, adiposity, glucose tolerance, and plasma glucose.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the Coffea arabica Linen (L.) leaf extract and its effects on platelet aggregation of dyslipidemic rats. The extract was obtained by the percolation of C. arabica L. leaves in hydroethanolic solution 70% (v/v). The mass spectrometry FIA-ESI-MS2 suggested the presence of chlorogenic acid, rutin acid, and quinic acid. The DPPH(center dot )radicals scavenging capacity was demonstrated (IC50 = 0.06 mg/mL). The extract was administered to rats by gavage (300 mg/kg/day) for 56 days. Dyslipidemia was induced by administering Triton WR-1339 (300 mg/kg body weight) on the 54th day. On day 56, blood was collected by puncturing the abdominal aorta artery and the aortic artery was removed. Lipid profile, markers of renal and hepatic injury, lipid peroxidation, and platelet aggregation tests were carried out. The ingestion of extract reduced the lipid peroxidation (aorta and plasma) and platelet aggregation in dyslipidemic rats. The extract did not affect markers of renal and hepatic function as analyzed in this study, suggesting neither impaired liver nor kidney function in these animals. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the extract of leaves of C. arabica L. show antioxidant potential in vitro and in vivo as well as anti-platelet aggregation in dyslipidemic animals.

AB BackgroundLipid droplet (LD) is a metabolically active organelle, which changes dynamically with the metabolic state and energy requirements of cells. Proteins that either insert into the LD phospholipid monolayer or are present in the cytoplasm, playing a crucial role in lipid homeostasis and signaling regulation, are known as LD-associated proteins.MethodsThe keywords "lipid droplets" and "metabolic diseases" were used to obtain literature on LD metabolism and pathological mechanism. After searching databases including Scopus, OVID, Web of Science, and PubMed from 2013 to 2024 using terms like "lipid droplets", "lipid droplet-associated proteins", "fatty liver disease", "diabetes", "diabetic kidney disease", "obesity", "atherosclerosis", "hyperlipidemia", "natural drug monomers" and "natural compounds", the most common natural compounds were identified in about 954 articles. Eventually, a total of 91 studies of 10 natural compounds reporting in vitro or in vivo studies were refined and summarized.ResultsThe most frequently used natural compounds include Berberine, Mangostin, Capsaicin, Caffeine, Genistein, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, Chlorogenic acid, Betaine, Ginsenoside, Resveratrol. These natural compounds interact with LD-associated proteins and help ameliorate abnormal LDs in various metabolic diseases.ConclusionNatural compounds involved in the regulation of LDs and LD-associated proteins hold promise for treating metabolic diseases. Further research into these interactions may lead to new therapeutic applications.

AB Caffeic acid (CA) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) are phenolic compounds claimed to be responsible for the metabolic effects of coffee and tea consumption. Along with their structural similarities, they share common mechanisms such as activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-obesity potential of CA and CGA as co-treatment in human adipocytes. The molecular interactions of CA and CGA with key adipogenic transcription factors were simulated through an in silico molecular docking approach. The expression levels of white and brown adipocyte markers, as well as genes related to lipid metabolism, were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses. Mechanistically, the CA/CGA combination induced lipolysis, upregulated AMPK and browning gene expression and downregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) at both transcriptional and protein levels. The gene expression profiles of the CA/CGA-co-treated adipocytes strongly resembled brown-like signatures. Major pathways identified included the AMPK- and PPAR-related signaling pathways. Collectively, these findings indicated that CA/CGA co-stimulation exerted a browning-inducing potential superior to that of either compound used alone which merits implementation in obesity management. Further, the obtained data provide additional insights on how CA and CGA modify adipocyte function, differentiation and lipid metabolism.

AB In the last few decades, numerous studies pertaining to research groups worldwide have investigated the effects of oral caffeine intake on fat oxidation at rest, during exercise, and after exercise. However, there is no bibliometric analysis to assess the large volume of scientific output associated with this topic. A bibliometric analysis of this topic may be used by researchers to assess the current scientific interest in the application of caffeine as a nutritional strategy to augment fat oxidation, the journals with more interest in this type of publication, and to draw international collaborations between groups working in the same area. For these reasons, the purpose of this study was to assess the research activity regarding oral caffeine intake and fat oxidation rate in the last few decades by conducting a bibliometric and visual analysis. Relevant publications from 1992 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database. Quantitative and qualitative variables were collected, including the number of publications and citations, H-indexes, journals of citation reports, co-authorship, co-citation, and the co-occurrence of keywords. There were 182 total publications, while the number of annual publications is saw-shaped with a modest increase of 11.3% from 2000 to 2009 to 2010 to 2019. The United States was the country with the highest number of publications (24.17% of the total number of articles), followed by the Netherlands (17.03%). According to citation analyses, the average number of citations per document is 130, although there are 21 documents that have received more than 100 citations; the most cited document reached 644 citations. These citation data support the overall relevance of this topic in the fields of nutrition and dietetics and sport sciences that when combined harbored 85.71% of all articles published in the WoS. The most productive author was Westerterp-Plantenga with 16 articles (8.79% of the total number of articles). Nutrients was the journal that published the largest number of articles on this topic (6.59% of the total number of articles). Last, there is a tendency to include keywords such as "performance", "carbohydrate", and "ergogenic aid" in the newer articles, while "obesity", "thermogenic", and "tea" are the keywords more commonly included in older documents. Although research into the role of caffeine on fat oxidation has existed since the 1970s, our analysis suggests that the scientific output associated with this topic has progressively increased since 1992, demonstrating that this is a nutritional research area with a strong foundational base of scientific evidence. Based on the findings of this bibliometric analysis, future investigation may consider focusing on the effects of sex and tolerance to caffeine to widen the assessment of the effectiveness of oral caffeine intake as a nutritional strategy to augment the use of fat as a fuel, as these terms rarely appear in the studies included in this analysis. Additionally, more translational research is necessary as the studies that investigate the effect of oral caffeine intake in ecologically valid contexts (i.e., exercise training programs for individuals with excessive adiposity) are only a minor part of the studies on this topic.

AB Dendropanax morbifera (DM), a medicinal plant, is rich in polyphenols and commonly used to treat cancer, inflammation, and thrombosis. However, to date, no study has been conducted on DM regarding the enormous drift of secondary metabolites of plants in different regions of the Republic of Korea and their effects on antiobesity, to explore compounds that play an important role in two major obesity-related pathways. Here, we present an in-depth study on DM samples collected from three regions of the Republic of Korea [Jeju Island (DMJ), Bogildo (DMB), and Jangheung (DMJG)]. We used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and multivariate component analyses to analyze polyphenol contents (neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, and rutin), followed by discrimination of the samples in DMJG using single nucleotide polymorphism and chemometric analysis. In silico and in vitro evaluation of major compounds found in the plant extract on two major anti-obesity pathways (adipogenesis and thermogenesis) was carried out. Furthermore, two extraction methods (Soxhlet and ultrasound-assisted extraction) were used to understand which method is better and why. Upon quantifying plant samples in three regions with the polyphenols, DMJG had the highest content of polyphenols. The internal transcribed region (ITS) revealed a specific gel-based band for the authentication of DMJG. PCA and PLS-DA revealed the polyphenol's discriminative power of the region DMJG. The anti-obesity effects of plant extracts from the three regions were related to their polyphenol contents, with DMJG showing the highest effect followed by DMJ and DMB. Ultrasound-assisted extraction yielded a high number of polyphenols compared to that of the Soxhlet method, which was supported by scanning electron microscopy. The present work encourages studies on plants rich in secondary metabolites to efficiently use them for dietary and therapeutic purposes.

AB Aim: Maternal caffeine crosses the placenta and mammary barriers, reaching the baby and, because his/her caffeine metabolism is immature, our hypothesis is that even a low caffeine intake (250 mg/day), lower than the dose limit recommended by the World Health Organization, can promote caffeine overexposure in the offspring, leading to short- and long-term changes. Main methods: Pregnant Wistar rats received intragastric caffeine (CAF) (25 mg/Kg/day) or vehicle during the gestation and lactation periods. We evaluated morphometrical, metabolic, hormonal, and behavioral parameters of male and female offspring at different ages. Key findings: Even a low caffeine intake promoted lower maternal body mass and adiposity, higher plasma cholesterol and lower plasma T3, without changes in plasma corticosterone. Female CAF offspring exhibited lower birth weight, body mass gain and food intake throughout life, and hyperinsulinemia at weaning, while male CAF offspring showed reduced food intake and lower plasma T3 at weaning. At puberty and adulthood, male CAF showed higher preference for palatable food, aversion to caffeine intake and higher locomotor activity, while female CAF only showed lower preference for high fat diet (HFD) and lower anxiety-like behavior. At adulthood, both male and female offspring showed higher plasma T3. Male CAF showed hypertestosteronemia, while female CAF showed hypoinsulinemia without effect on glucose tolerance. Significance: A low caffeine intake during the perinatal period affects rat's offspring development, promoting sexdependent hormonal and behavior changes. Current data suggest the need to review caffeine recommendations during the perinatal period.

AB Background: The measurement of proglucagon-derived peptides (PGDPs) is a challenging task mainly due to major overlaps in their molecular sequence in addition to their low circulating levels. Here, we present the technical characteristics of novel ELISA assays measuring C-peptide and all six PGDPs including, for the first time, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), and we validate them by performing a pilot in vivo cross-over randomized clinical trial on whether coffee consumption may affect levels of circulating PGDPs.
   Methods: The performance and technical characteristics of novel ELISA assays from Ansh measuring GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, MPGF and C-peptide were first evaluated in vitro in procured samples from a commercial vendor as well as in deidentified human samples from three previously performed clinical studies. Their performance was further evaluated in vivo in the context of a cross-over randomized controlled trial, in which 33 subjects consumed in random order and together with a standardized meal, 200 ml of either (a) instant coffee with 3 mg/kg caffeine, or (b) instant coffee with 6 mg/kg caffeine, (c) or water.
   Results: All assays demonstrated high accuracy (spike and recovery and average linearity recovery +/- 15%), precision (inter-assay CV <= 6.4%), specificity (no significant cross-reactivities) and they were sensitive in low concentrations. Measurements of glicentin in archived random human samples using the Ansh assay correlated strongly with the glicentin measurements of Mercodia assay (r = 0.968) and of GLP-1 modestly with Millipore GLP-1 assay (r = 0.440). Oxyntomodulin, glicentin and glucagon concentrations were 2-5 fold higher in plasma compared to serum and serum concentrations correlated modestly (for oxyntomodulin and glicentin) or poorly (for glucagon) with the plasma concentrations. The evaluated assays detected a postprandial increase of gutsecreted PGDPs (GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin and glicentin) and a postprandial decrease of pancreas-secreted PGDPs (glucagon, MPGF) in response to consuming coffee in comparison to consuming water with breakfast (enter here composition of breakfast). Only coffee consumption at the high dose alter levels of gut-secreted PGDPs and both at low and high dose to lower levels of pancreas-secreted PGDPs compared to water consumption during breakfast.
   Conclusion: Accurate, precise and specific measurement of six PGDPs is possible with novel assays. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated in vivo utility of those assays and supports the notion that coffee may exert part of its beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis in the short term through the regulation of PGDPs.

AB Potatoes are consumed worldwide because of their high accessibility, low cost, taste, and diversity of cooking methods. The high carbohydrate content of potatoes masks the presence of-vitamins, polyphenols, minerals, amino acids, lectins and protein inhibitors in the minds of consumers. The consumption of potatoes faces challenges among health-conscious people. This review paper attempted to provide up-to-date information on new metabolites reported in potatoes that play role in disease prevention and overall human well-being. We tried to compile information on antidiabetic, antihypertensive, anticancer, antiobesity, antihyperlipidemic, and anti-inflammatory potential of potato along with role in improving gut health and satiety. In-vitro studies, human cell culture, and experimental animal and human clinical studies showed potatoes to exhibit a variety of health -enhancing properties. This article will not only popularize potato as a healthy food, but will also improve its use as a staple for the foreseeable future.

AB Adipose browning leads to increased energy expenditure and reduced adiposity and has, therefore, become an attractive therapeutic strategy for obesity. In this study, we elucidated the effect of green tea aqueous extract (GTAE) on the browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (Ing-WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The main phytochemical components identified in GTAE through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) included (-)-gallocatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, caffeine, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-gallocatechin gallate, and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate. Daily supplementation with 1% GTAE for 12 weeks markedly reduced bodyweight gain, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and improved insulin resistance. Additionally, histological analysis revealed that dietary supplementation with 1% GTAE reversed HFD-induced adipocyte size and hepatic steatosis. These effects were associated with activation of browning in the Ing-WAT and BAT, which mediate systemic metabolic dysfunction in HFD-fed mice. Taken together, our data support the use of GTAE, a natural product, for the attenuation of obesity through the activation of fat browning.

AB Aim The plant-based polyphenol-rich extract TOTUM-63 improves glucose homeostasis in various preclinical models of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). A pilot exploratory study showed that TOTUM-63 has good safety and tolerability profiles, and beneficial effects on postprandial glucose control in healthy individuals with overweight. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of TOTUM-63 on glycaemic control in individuals with prediabetes or early stage newly-diagnosed T2D (which does not require pharmacological treatment). Materials and Methods This study was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Individuals with prediabetes or early stage newly-diagnosed T2D and with overweight/abdominal obesity received TOTUM-63 (5 g/day) or placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was the change in fasting blood glucose. Results Fifty-one participants (age: 57.1 +/- 10 years; body mass index: 31.3 +/- 5.7 kg.m(2); 35 women and 16 men) completed the study (n = 38 TOTUM-63, n = 13 placebo). After 6 months, blood glucose concentration after fasting and after the 2-h oral glucose tolerance test was reduced in the TOTUM-63-treated group compared with the placebo group (placebo-corrected difference between baseline and month 6: -0.71 mmol/L, p < .05, and -1.93 mmol/L, p < .05, respectively). TOTUM-63 was safe and well tolerated and significantly reduced body weight gain (-1.9 kg; p < .05), waist circumference (-4.5 cm; p < .001), circulating triglycerides (-0.54 mmol/L; p < .01) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-0.38 mmol/L; p < .05) compared with placebo. Conclusions TOTUM-63 lowered fasting blood glucose in participants with impaired fasting glycaemia and glucose intolerance. Moreover, TOTUM-63 showed a good safety and tolerability profile and improved several metabolic syndrome features. Therefore, TOTUM-63 is a promising candidate for T2D prevention.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effects of coffee consum ption on molecular changes and adipose tissue remodeling in a murine model of high-fat diet-induced obesity. Three-month-old C57BL/6 mice were initially divided into three groups, namely, control (C), high-fat (HF), and coffee prevention (HF-CP) groups, and the HF group was subdivided at the end of the 10th week into two subgroups, an HF group and a coffee treatment (HF-CT) group; thus, a total of four groups were investigated at the 14th week of the experiment. The HF-CP group had lower body mass than the HF group ( -7%, P < .05) and a better distribution of adipose tissue. Both groups that received coffee (HF-CP and HF-CT) showed improved glucose metabolism compared with the HF group. Coffee consumption also attenuated adipose tissue inflammation and showed decreased macrophage infiltration and lower IL-6 levels compared with the HF group (HF-CP: -337% %, P < .05; HF-CT: -275%, P < .05). Hepatic steatosis and inflammation were attenuated in the HF-CP and HF-CT groups. The HF-CP group showed more pronounced expression of genes involved in adaptive thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis (PPAR gamma, Prdm16, Pcg1 alpha, beta 3-adrenergic receptor, Ucp-1, and Opa-1) than the other experimental groups. Preventive coffee consumption associated with a high-fat diet ameliorates the metabolic profile related to the development of obesity and its comorbidities. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB Few studies have examined the association between coffee consumption and muscle mass; their results are conflicting. Therefore, we examined the association between coffee consumption and low muscle mass prevalence. We also performed an exploratory investigation of the potential effect modification by demographic, health status-related and physical activity-related covariates. This cross-sectional study included 2085 adults aged 40-87 years. The frequency of coffee consumption was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. Muscle mass was assessed as appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height(2) using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyser. We defined low muscle mass using cut-offs recommended by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. Multivariable-adjusted OR for low muscle mass prevalence were estimated using a logistic regression model. The prevalence of low muscle mass was 5 center dot 4 % (n 113). Compared with the lowest coffee consumption group (< 1 cup/week), the multivariable-adjusted OR (95 % CI) of low muscle mass prevalence were 0 center dot 62 (0 center dot 30, 1 center dot 29) for 1-3 cups/week, 0 center dot 53 (0 center dot 29, 0 center dot 96) for 4-6 cups/week or 1 cup/d and 0 center dot 28 (0 center dot 15, 0 center dot 53) for >= 2 cups/d (P for trend < 0 center dot 001). There were no significant interactions among the various covariates after Bonferroni correction. In conclusion, coffee consumption may be inversely associated with low muscle mass prevalence.

AB Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a phenolic acid compound found in a variety of natural plants, has strong antioxidant capacity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of CGA on differentiation and lipid metabolism of 3T3-L1 cells, as well as its protective effect against cellular oxidative stress induced by H2O2. We found that CGA can reduce the accumulation of intracellular ROS and attenuate the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha under oxidative stress. CGA treatment significantly inhibited preadipocytes differentiation and lipid accumula-tion in 3T3-L1 cells. Our results suggest that CGA may regulate lipid metabolism by reducing the expression of differentiation-related genes and inhibiting triacylglyceride synthesis. The findings of this study support CGA as a potential therapeutic agent for obesity. The effects of CGA and its metabolites in vivo should be investigated to further support its application in functional foods.

AB Despite a multitude of investigations assessing the impact of green coffee extract supplementation on obesity indices, there is still a great deal of heated debate regarding the benefits of this intervention in obesity management. Therefore, in order to clarify the effect of green coffee extract on waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI) and body weight (BW), we conducted an umbrella review of interventional meta-analyses. The Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/Medline, and Embase databases were searched using specific keywords and word combinations. The umbrella meta-analysis was performed using the Stata software version 17 (Stata Corp. College Station, Texas, USA). We pooled effect sizes (ES) and confidence intervals (CI) for the outcomes using the random effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method). In total, 5 eligible meta-analyses were included in the final quantitative assessment. Data pooled from 5 eligible papers revealed that green coffee extract can reduce BW (WMD: -1.22 kg, 95% CI: -1.53 to -0.92, p < 0.001), BMI (WMD: -0.48 kg/m(2), 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.29, p < 0.001) and WC (WMD: -0.55 cm, 95% CI: -0.80 to -0.31, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses highlighted that green coffee extract supplementation in dosages & LE;600 mg/day and interventions lasting >7 wk are more likely to decrease BW. The present umbrella meta-analysis confirms the beneficial effects of green coffee extract in reducing WC, BMI, and BW. Thus, we may infer that green coffee extract can be used as a complementary therapy in the management of obesity.

AB Purpose High coffee consumption is associated with low risk of mortality and morbidity, but the causality remains unclear. This review aims to discuss findings from observational studies on coffee consumption in context of Mendelian randomization studies. Methods The PubMed database was searched for all Mendelian randomization studies on coffee consumption and corresponding observational studies. Results High coffee consumption is associated with low risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in observational studies (HRs of 0.85-0.90 vs. no/low consumers), with no support of causality in Mendelian randomization studies. Moderate/high consumption is associated with low risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including ischemic heart disease (HRs of 0.85-0.90 vs. no/low consumption), stroke (HRs of approximately 0.80 vs. no/low consumption), type 2 diabetes (HRs of approximately 0.70 vs. no/low consumption) and obesity in observational studies, but not in Mendelian randomization studies. High consumption is associated with low risk of endometrial cancer and melanoma and high risk of lung cancer in observational studies, but with high risk of colorectal cancer in Mendelian randomization studies. In observational and Mendelian randomization studies, high coffee consumption is associated with low risk of gallstones (HRs of 0.55-0.70 for high vs. no/low self-reported and 0.81 (0.69-0.96) for highest vs. lowest genetic consumption). Conclusion High coffee consumption is associated with low risk of mortality, cardiometabolic diseases, some cancers and gallstones in observational studies, with no evidence to support causality from Mendelian randomization studies for most diseases except gallstones.

AB Introduction: Due to their stressful lives, Palestinian refugees are prone to use cognitive enhancers (CE) and psychostimulant substances (PS). Recognising health problems asso-ciated with CE/PS use can indicate how preventive programs should be directed towards adolescents. Unfortunately, research has not thoroughly investigated the health problems related to tobacco and caffeine products, the most socially acceptable CE/PS among Palestinian refugee adolescents. Methodology: In 2021, schoolchildren from five Palestinian refugee camps (N=271) aged 12-<16 years agreed to give blood samples and to be interviewed to address the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and tobacco smoking, coffee, energy drinks (ED), black tea, and chocolate consumption. MetS was diagnosed based on International Diabetic Federation Criteria. To address the association, we used binary logistic regression models adjusted to age, gender, BMI, and central obesity. Results: The prevalence of MetS was [17 (6.3%)]; (7.4%) in males, (5.1%) in females. The prevalence of substance use was as follows: ED [163 (48.9%)], coffee [255 (76.6%)], black tea [295 (89.1%)], cigarette [35 (10.5%)], waterpipe [59 (17.7%)], and chocolate [309 (93.6%)], with male predominance. Cigarette smokers have increased central obesity (p-value=0.024), and decreased HDL-cholesterol (p-value=0.015) than non-smokers. Similar results were observed for waterpipe smokers besides the increased levels of trigly-cerides (p-value=0.01). ED consumers have increased central obesity (p-value=0.03) and fast blood sugar (p-value=0.003) than non-consumers. Chocolate consumers have decreased central obesity (p-value=0.008) and increased HDL levels (p-value=0.04) than non-consumers. ED consumers were significantly at higher risk of MetS (OR=9.97, p-value=0.019) than non-consumers and chocolate consumers were at lower risk of MetS (OR=0.14, p-value=0.046) than non-consumers. Waterpipe smokers were at a higher risk of having increased plasma triglycerides than non-consumers (OR=3.4, p-value=0.03). Conclusion: The high prevalence of ED consumption and waterpipe smoking in Palestinian refugee adolescents is problematic. Their use was associated with higher odds of MetS, dyslipidemia, and central obesity, which justifies greater attention.

AB Obesity is a global issue faced by many individuals worldwide. However, no drug has a pronounced effect with few side effects. Green tea, a well-known natural product, shows preventive effects against obesity by decreasing lipogenesis and increasing fat oxidation and antioxidant capacity. In contrast, other natural products are known to contribute to obesity. Relevant articles published on the therapeutic effect of natural products on obesity were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. The search was conducted by entering keywords such as "obesity", "natural product", and "clinical trial". The natural products were classified as single compounds, foods, teas, fruits, herbal medicines-single extract, herbal medicines-decoction, and herbal medicines-external preparation. Then, the mechanisms of these medicines were organized into lipid metabolism, anti-inflammation, antioxidation, appetite loss, and thermogenesis. This review aimed to assess the efficacy and mechanisms of effective natural products in managing obesity. Several clinical studies reported that natural products showed antiobesity effects, including Coffea arabica (coffee), Camellia sinensis (green tea), Caulerpa racemosa (green algae), Allium sativum (garlic), combined Ephedra intermedia Schrenk, Thea sinensis L., and Atractylodes lancea DC extract (known as Gambisan), Ephedra sinica Stapf, Angelica Gigantis Radix, Atractylodis Rhizoma Alba, Coicis semen, Cinnamomi cortex, Paeoniae radix alba, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis (known as Euiiyin-tang formula). Further studies are expected to refine the pharmacological effects of natural products for clinical use.

AB (1) Background: Overweight and obesity are emerging global problems causing multiple health complications. Excessive fat tissue content leads to chronic inflammation, which is why antioxidative compounds that could potentially reduce these processes are possible agents that could be supplemented in order to prevent metabolic complications of overweight and obesity. Apples and dwarf kiwis are good sources of antioxidative agents such as quercetin and chlorogenic acid. The aim of this study was to assess if apple and dwarf kiwi nutraceutical supplementation can improve the metabolic parameters of overweight adults. (2) Methods: 43 participants were enrolled in the double-blinded pilot study: 21 in the supplementation group and 22 in the placebo group. The one 1000 mg nutraceutical capsule contained 10% Chopin apple peel extract, 10% whole dwarf kiwi fruit extract, 75% Chopin apple core extract, and 5% rapeseed peptides. The supplementation group received two capsules/day for 60 days. (3) Results: The supplementation of the apple and kiwi product resulted in a lowering of ALT in the supplementation group (from 29.65 +/- 19.02 UI/L to 23.80 +/- 13.76 UI/L; p = 0.01). Subgroup analysis in men and women showed a significant decrease in total cholesterol level (from 220.15 +/- 36.69 mg/dL to 208.43 +/- 37.09 mg/dL; p = 0.04), non-HDL cholesterol (from 161.17 +/- 41.00 mg/dL to 145.69 +/- 41.75 mg/dL; p = 0.02) and ALT (from 25.41 +/- 12.05 UI/L to 19.07 +/- 6.13 UI/L; p = 0.01) in women and triglycerides levels (from 212.74 +/- 127.15 mg/dL to 155.63 +/- 80.61 mg/dL; p = 0.047) in men. (4) Conclusions: The supplementation of nutraceuticals from apples and dwarf kiwi led to improvements in lipid profile. It can be a possible new agent for counteracting overweight metabolic complications, however, larger group studies and more detailed tests are needed to support these preliminary findings.

AB We aimed to investigate associations of dietary intakes with unhealthy metabolic phenotype development, in normal weight and overweight/obese adults separately. A total of 1114 individuals, aged >= 19 years, with healthy phenotype in the third examination cycle of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study were followed until the fifth examination. Dietary intakes were estimated using the food frequency questionnaires, collected during the study. The participants were grouped as normal weight and overweight/obese according to the baseline body mass index (BMI). Unhealthy metabolic status was determined as having more than one component of metabolic syndrome using the Joint Interim Statement. Regardless of BMI, higher intakes of magnesium, dairy products, poultry, apples/pears, citrus fruits, and tea/coffee decreased the risk of developing unhealthy phenotype, while higher intakes of fast foods, organ meats, and potatoes increased the risk. Food intake can influence the transition to unhealthy phenotype in metabolically healthy adults, irrespective of the BMI status.

AB The effective components of mulberry leaf polyphenols (MLPs) should be absorbed and transported by the intestinal cells before regulating lipid metabolism. The Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell and 3 T3-L1 adipocytes were coupled to screen the effective components of MLPs that are being absorbed and transported by intestinal cells. The regulation and molecular mechanism by which the effective components affect adipogenesis were analyzed in this study. Among the 12 main components identified, five main compounds were well absorbed with Papp in the order of benzoic acid > chlorogenic acid > astragaloside > hyperoside > rutin. Chlorogenic acid and benzoic acid were mainly absorbed through passive diffusion, while rutin, astragaloside, and hyperoside were mainly by active transport, of which chlorogenic and rutin absorption were mediated by the efflux protein, P-glycoprotein (P-pg). Based on the transport volume of 2 mg/ml MLPs within 2 h, 25% of the maximum transported MLPs (TMLPs) was a safe concentration for 3 T3-L1 preadipocytes. Except for astragaloside, the other four components showed a significant inhibitory effect on lipid droplets, TG and TC, and chlorogenic acid and benzoic acid had the strongest effect. Additionally, we observed a synergistic effect as TMLPs were the most effective. We hypothesized that TMLPs, chlorogenic acid and benzoic acid suppressed adipogenesis and regulated lipid metabolism by inhibiting PPAR-gamma, C/EBP-alpha, and FAS mRNA while promoting ADIPO and Leptin mRNA expression. Practical applications The absorption and adipogenesis inhibition effect of mulberry leaf phenolics were evaluated in this study. The results provided guideline for the development of functional foods in regulating lipid metabolism.

AB An emerging strategy for reducing obesity is induction of brown fat type phenotype in white adipose tissue. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a dietary polyphenol, has been reported to modulate lipid and glucose metabolism, and improve glucose tolerance. However, information on its role in adipocyte browning is lacking. The effect of CGA on browning of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and differentiated white adipocytes was investigated. Treatment of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes with CGA produced more adipocytes with multilocular phenotype, typical of brown adipocytes. Increase in uncoupler protein-1(UCP1)(1.7-fold) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha)(2-fold) and decrease in triacyl glycerol content (50%) suggested that CGA promotes browning. Morphological analysis and expression of UCP1 further showed that CGA induced trans-differentiation of 3T3-L1 white adipocytes cells to beige adipocytes. Increased phosphorylation of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) in cells treated with CGA and reversal of CGA stimulated browning by dorsomorphin, an inhibitor of AMPK, suggested that AMPK pathway is involved in mediating the effect of CGA.

AB Aims: The relationship between caffeine and metabolic syndrome (MetS) has only been evaluated from the perspective of caffeine consumption. The association between urinary caffeine and MetS is still unclear. This study examined the associations between urinary caffeine and its metabolites and MetS and its components among adults.Methods: Data from the United States (US) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014 was analyzed. NHANES is a stratified, multi-stage survey of all non-institutionalized persons in the US. A total of 2,394 subjects aged >= 18 years without missing data were selected in this study. Urinary caffeine and caffeine metabolite levels were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) with stable isotope-labeled internal standards. We performed principal components analysis (PCA) to investigate the underlying correlation structure of 15 features of urinary caffeine and its metabolites and then used these principal components (PCs) as independent variables to conduct logistic regression analysis with or without restricted cubic spline (RCS) terms to explore the associations between caffeine metabolites and MetS.Results: Two main PCs that were derived from the PCA explained 90.67% of the total variance of caffeine and its metabolites. The first PC (PC1, strongly correlated with 1-MU, 1,3-DMU, 1,7-DMU, 1,3,7-TMU, 1-MX, 1,3-DMX, 1,7-DMX, 1,3,7-TMX, and AAMU) was positively correlated with risk of MetS (OR = 1.27, p < 0.001) and all its components (all ORs > 1, all p-values < 0.001) in the unadjusted models, while in the adjusted models, it was positively correlated with MetS (OR = 1.16, p = 0.042) and central obesity (OR = 1.22, p < 0.001). In the unadjusted model, there were significant associations between the second PC (PC2, correlated with 3-MU, 7-MU, 3,7-DMU, 3-MX, 7-MX, and 3,7-DMX) and MetS (OR = 1.11, P = 0.030) and central obesity (OR = 1.16, P < 0.001), while in the adjusted models (adjustment variables include gender, age, race/ethnicity, education level and income-poverty ratio, smoking status, drinking, and physical activity), PC2 was positively associated with MetS (OR = 1.15, p = 0.035) and central obesity (OR = 1.15, p = 0.005) and negatively associated with raised triglycerides (TG) (OR = 0.84, p = 0.008). Moreover, we observed U-shaped associations between PC1 and the risk of raised TG both in unadjusted (Pnon-linear = 0.017) and adjusted (Pnon-linear = 0.014) models.Conclusion: Urinary caffeine metabolites were positively associated with the risk of MetS and its components through different linear or non-linear patterns.

AB With the progress of modern society, obesity has gradually emerged as a major public health challenge. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the potential of caffeine (CAF) as a nutritional tool for combating obesity. While previous studies has demonstrated CAF's ability to directly influence white adipose tissue (WAT) by promoting browning and reducing obesity, the role of muscle in obesity reduction should not be overlooked. Given that exercise is a primary component of weight loss, our study aimed to investigate whether CAF can alleviate adiposity by modulating the skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk. Our study demonstrates that CAF can alleviate obesity by enhancing the expression of PGC-1 alpha through calcium-related signaling pathways in skeletal muscle, which subsequently induces the production of Irisin in myotubes and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice in vitro. Irisin, in turn, circulates to WAT and promotes browning, thus providing a theoretical foundation for the use of CAF as a nutritional tool for weight control. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of CAF in modulating skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk and suggest that it may be an effective tool for reducing obesity.

AB Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is a condition that precedes diabetes and increases the risk of developing it. Studies support the hypoglycemic effect of Cynara scolymus (Cs) extracts due to the content of chlorogenic acid, which is a potent inhibitor of glucose 6-phosphate translocase and of dicaffeoylquinic acid derivatives that modulate the activity of alpha-glucosidase. Given this background, we investigated whether a new highly standardized Cs extract could improve glycemic control, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters (total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) Triglycerides, Apolipo protein B (ApoB), Apolipo protein A (ApoA), waist circumference, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in overweight subjects with newly diagnosed IFG. Fifty-four subjects (females/males 26/28, mean +/- SD age 51.5 +/- 6.2) were randomly assigned to the supplemented group (n = 27) and placebo (n = 27). After multiple testing correction, statistically significant interactions between time and group were observed for the primary endpoint glycemia (beta = 0.36, p < 0.0001) and for the secondary endpoints HDL (beta = -0.10, p < 0.0001), total cholesterol/HDL (beta = 0.27, p < 0.0001), LDL (beta = 0.15, p = 0.005), LDL/HDL (beta = 0.23, p = 0.001), insulin (beta = 1.28, p = 0.04), glycated hemoglobin (beta = 0.21, p = 0.0002), A1c-derived average glucose (beta = 0.34, p = 0.0002), ApoB (beta = 6.00, p = 0.01), ApoA (beta = -4.50, p = 0.04), ApoB/ApoA (beta = 0.08, p = 0.003), waist circumference (beta = 1.89, p = 0.05), VAT beta = 222.37, p = 0.005). In conclusion, these results confirm that Cs supplementation has a significant effect on metabolic parameters in IFG patients.

AB The Nutrition Transition model posits that vegetable oils, animal source foods (ASFs) and caloric sweeteners contribute to increases in adiposity and hence body mass index. Body mass index (BMI) is increasing more rapidly among Latin American populations of low versus high socioeconomic status (SES). The objectives of this study among Costa Rican women were to: (1) compare indicators of adiposity and dietary intake by SES and (2) evaluate the relationship between intake of foods high in vegetable oils, ASFs or caloric sweeteners and body fatness. This cross-sectional study, conducted in 2014-2015, included 128 low-, middle- and high-SES non-pregnant, non-lactating women aged between 25 and 45 years with 1-4 live births. Anthropometry was used to assess BMI, body composition and body fat distribution. Dietary recalls (n= 379) were used to assess dietary intake. Percentage body fat was greater in low- versus high-SES women (31.5 +/- 3.9 vs 28.2 +/- 4.7%). Skinfold measurements at four sites on the upper and lower body were greater in low- versus high-SES women. Body mass index did not vary in low- versus high-SES women. Intake frequency of foods high in vegetable oils was greater in low- and middle- (1.8 and 1.8 times/day, respectively) versus high- (1.1 times/day) SES women. For individual foods, intake frequency varied significantly by SES for high-fat condiments, fried vegetables, dairy, sweetened coffee/tea and pastries and desserts. Intake frequency of Nutrition Transition food categories was not associated with percentage body fat after adjustment for energy intake. Indicators of body composition provide additional information beyond BMI that are useful in understanding SES-adiposity associations in Latin America. Approaches to understanding diet and adiposity in Latin America that focus on vegetable oils, ASFs and caloric sweeteners should consider within-country variation in the pace of the Nutrition Transition, especially when explaining variation in adiposity by SES.

AB The goal of the current study was to examine the therapeutic potential of green coffee bean extract (GCBE) in the treatment of diabetic hepatic damage induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) administration. The novelty of this study lies in constructing a newly stabilized in vivo obese diabetic animal model in rats using HFD/STZ for investigating the dose-dependent effect of two commonly used doses of GCBE in hepatoprotection against oxidative stress-induced hepatic damage by measuring many parameters that have not been carried out previously in other studies. GCBE that was used in this study was a hot water extract of green coffee beans with a concentration of 0.1 g ml(-1). Male albino rats were given a single dose of STZ (35 mg kg(-1)), and HFD to induce diabetes mellitus (DM). For 28 days, two separate doses of GCBE 50 mg kg(-1) and 100 mg kg(-1) were administered orally to diabetic animals. Leptin, liver enzymes, oxidative stress parameters, inflammatory parameters, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), and lipid profile levels were examined. Real-time PCR and ELISA were used to quantitatively detect the mRNAs of the genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway, the genes involved in glucose metabolism, and the amounts of proteins. The levels of FPG, lipid profile, liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, and leptin in the HFD/STZ diabetic group revealed a considerable spike, while they considerably decreased after GCBE treatment in a dose-dependent manner. After GCBE treatment, the diabetic group showed a significant rise in the antioxidant markers glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, as well as a decrease in malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels. The liver changes caused by HFD/STZ were entirely reversed by GCBE, and most intriguingly, in a dose-dependent manner. We concluded that GCBE can repair the hepatic oxidative damage caused by HFD and STZ by reversing all the previously measured parameters and improving the insulin signaling pathways. GCBE demonstrated strong antifree radical activity and significantly protected cells from oxidative damage caused by HFD/STZ.

AB Blueberry fruit exhibits strong antioxidant activity owing to the presence of anthocyanin. As blueberry-leaf extract (BLE) contains chlorogenic acid and flavonol glycosides, we hypothesized that phenolic-enriched BLE would improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In this study, we examined whether BLE administration decreases the glucose levels and enhances the pancreatic function in mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and diabetes. C57BL/6J mice were divided into the following four groups: control diet (CD), HFD (60 kcal% fat diet), BLE (HFD with 1% BLE wt/wt diet), and yerba mate extract (YME; HFD with 0.5% YME wt/wt diet). Dietary BLE and YME reduced glucose tolerance, body weight, and plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglyceride (TG), and non-esterified fatty acid levels. Compared with those of the HFD group, BLE was found to significantly reduce the pancreatic islet size and insulin content. Moreover, it increased the mRNA levels of pancreatic beta-cell proliferation related genes, Ngn3, MafA, Pax4, Ins1, and Ins2, and pancreatic insulin signaling-related genes, IRS-1, IRS-2, PIK3ca, PDK1, PKC epsilon, and GLUT-2, and decreased the transcriptional expression of the beta-cell apoptosis-related gene, FoxO1. Both BLE and YME improved insulin sensitivity by inhibiting TG synthesis and enhancing lipid utilization in the liver and white adipose tissue (WAT). In pancreatic MIN6 beta-cells, BLE and its main component (chlorogenic acid) increased beta-cell proliferation and promoted insulin signaling. Overall, BLE enriched with phenolic compounds has the capacity to prevent HFD-induced glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia by improving the pancreatic beta-cell function. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB IntroductionSarcopenic obesity is related to changes in body composition, loss of muscle mass, and raised adipose tissue. Beverage patterns are effective with changes in health status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between sarcopenic obesity (SO) and the healthy beverage index (HBI) in women with overweight and obesity.MethodsThis cross-sectional study conducted on 210 overweight and obese (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)) women aged 18-56 years. The measurement of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and fat mass (FM) done by bioelectric impedance analyzer (BIA) (Inbody Co., Seoul, Korea) based on guidelines. The two lowest quintiles SMM and the two highest quintiles FM and body mass index (BMI) >= 30 are considered sarcopenic obesity in women. A validated and reliable semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to evaluate the beverage dietary data. and RFS and NRFS was calculated. Biochemical assessments were quantified by standard approaches, and physical activity were evaluated by international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ).ResultIn this cross-sectional study, 210 overweight and obese females took part (18-56) years old). The studies were carried out using binary logistic regression. After controlling for a wide variety of confounding variables such as age, energy intake, physical activity, education, and economic status, we found a negative association between HBI and risk of SO (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.35 to 1.01, P = 0.05).ConclusionWe observed that the odds of SO was reduced by 69% in participants with higher HBI score. More well-designed studies need to confirm our findings.

AB Hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) are a major class of phenolic acids with the characteristic phenylpropanoid C-6-C-3 backbone. Its typically conjugated status with plant cell wall components and liberation by limited enzymes might be the reason for its neglect by researchers compared to flavonoid-type polyphenols. The polyphenol-gut microbiota interactions and their impact on human health have captured the interest of researchers recently. In addition, there has been a significant progress over the past few years in understanding the gut microbiota-modulating effect of HCA using animal model studies. This review discusses the metabolism of HCA in the digestive tract, HCA-gut microbiota interactions, and its link to colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, mental-cognitive impairments, nonalcoholic liver disease, and obesity. The effects of food matrix and processing technologies on HCA bioavailability and HCA-gut microbiota interactions, and HCA safety concerns are also featured in this review. This paper has provided an in-depth insight on HCA-gut microbiota relationship and identified the current literature gaps for future research.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations among the intake of total polyphenols, polyphenol classes, and polyphenol subclasses and body weight change over 5years.
   Methods: A total of 349,165 men and women aged 25 to 70years were recruited in the Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol, Cessation of Smoking, Eating Out of Home and Obesity (PANACEA) project of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort from nine European countries. Body weight was measured at baseline and at follow-up after a median time of 5years. Polyphenol intake, including four main polyphenol classes and eighteen subclasses, was estimated using validated dietary questionnaires and Phenol-Explorer. Multilevel mixed linear regression models were used to estimate the associations.
   Results: Participants gained, on average, 2.6 kg (5.0 kg) over 5years. Total flavonoids intake was inversely associated with body weight change (-0.195kg/5 years, 95% CI: -0.262 to -0.128). However, the intake of total polyphenols (0.205kg/5 years, 95% CI: 0.138 to 0.272) and intake of hydroxycinnamic acids (0.324kg/5 years, 95% CI: 0.267 to 0.381) were positively associated with body weight gain. In analyses stratified by coffee consumption, hydroxycinnamic acid intake was positively associated with body weight gain in coffee consumers (0.379kg/5 years, 95% CI: 0.319 to 0.440), but not in coffee nonconsumers (-0.179kg/5 years, 95% CI: -0.490 to 0.133).
   Conclusions: Higher intakes of flavonoids and their subclasses are inversely associated with a modest body weight change. Results regarding hydroxycinnamic acids in coffee consumers require further investigation.

AB Obesity and overweight are associated with an increasing risk of developing health conditions and chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, musculoskeletal problems, respiratory problems, and mental health, and its prevalence is rising. Diet is one of three primary lifestyle interventions. Many bioactive components in tea especially oolong tea, including flavonoids, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and caffeine were reported to show related effects in reducing the risk of obesity. However, the effects of GABA oolong tea extracts (OTEs) on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity are still unclear. Therefore, this study aims to explore whether the intervention of GABA OTEs can prevent HFD-induced obesity and decipher its underlying mechanisms using male C57BL/6 J mice. The result indicated that GABA OTEs reduced leptin expression in epididymal adipose tissue and showed a protective effect on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It promoted thermogenesis-related protein of uncoupling protein-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC-1a), boosted lipid metabolism, and promoted fatty acid oxidation. It also reduced lipogenesis-related protein levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase and inhibited hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels. These data suggest that regular drinking of GABA oolong tea has the potential to reduce the risk of being overweight, preventing obesity development through thermogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis.

AB BackgroundInflammation at the low-grade level has been found to contribute to obesity-induced insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle (SM). This study investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of metformin (MET) combined with chlorogenic acid (CGA) in SM of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD).Materials and methodsThe C57BL/6 mice were divided into five groups of ten each, normal diet, HFD, HFD + MET, HFD + CGA and HFD + MET + CGA.ResultsThe results revealed that MET and CGA, alone or in combination, have a reducing effect on weight gain, plasma triglyceride, glucose and insulin levels. MET in combination with CGA led to attenuation of SM inflammation, an effect that was associated with decreasing macrophages infiltration rate. Combined treatment of MET and CGA also resulted in switching macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype, presented by the higher expression levels of arginase and CD206 (M2 markers) and lower expression levels of iNOS and cd11c markers (M1). In addition, combination treatment was more effective in increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokines expression (IL-10) and decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, MCP-1 and IL-6).ConclusionThese findings suggest that the combination treatment of MET and CGA is likely to be a promising approach to control SM inflammation in the HFD-fed model.

AB Background: Chlorogenic Acid (CA) has diverse, recognized health effects.
   Objective: This study aimed to explore the effects of CA on fat reduction and the underlying mechanism of these effects.
   Materials and Methods: First, we established a Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)-induced obesity mouse model and subjected the mice to 4 weeks of CA gavage. Then, we established an oleic acid-induced model of human fatty liver in HepG2 cells, and administered a CA intervention to the cells for 48 h. Finally, we used Oil red O staining, biochemical detection kits, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis to evaluate the effects of CA on fat reduction and on related pathways.
   Results: The CA treatment could reduce fat accumulation in the liver and reduce blood lipid levels. In addition, CA decreased the mRNA and protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) and Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) in the MSG-induced obesity mouse model and the oleic acid-induced HepG2 cells.
   Conclusion: Based on the above results, we deduced that CA could reduce body weight and fat deposition in vitro and in vivo and that the mechanism may be related to the PGC-1 alpha/UCP-1 pathway. CA can be developed as a drug to lower blood lipids and to treat obesity.

AB Objectives: In this report, we investigated the association between established risk factors and type 2 diabetes (T2D) across 5 distinct ethnic groups and explored differences according to T2D definition within the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study. Methods: Using the full MEC, with participants in Hawaii and Los Angeles (N=172,230), we applied Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All participants completed questionnaires asking about demographics, anthropometrics, lifestyle factors, and regular diet. T2D status was determined from self-reported diagnosis/medication and Medicare claims. We assessed the associations between well-established risk factors and T2D in the full cohort, after stratification by ethnic group, according to the T2D definition, and in a biorepository subset. Effect modification by ethnicity was evaluated using Wald's tests. Results: Overall, 46,500 (27%) participants had an incident T2D diagnosis after a mean follow-up of 17.1 +/- 6.9 years. All predictors were significantly associated with T2D: overweight (HR=1.74), obesity (HR=2.90), red meat intake (HR=1.15), short (HR=1.04) and long (HR=1.08) sleep duration, and smoking (HR=1.26) pre-dicted a significantly higher T2D incidence, whereas coffee (HR=0.90) and alcohol (HR=0.78) consumption, physical activity (HR=0.89), and diet quality (HR=0.96) were associated with lower T2D incidence. The strength of these associations was similar across ethnic groups with noteworthy disparities for overweight/ obesity, physical activity, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, and diet quality. Conclusions: These findings confirm the importance of known risk factors for T2D across ethnic groups, but small differences were detected that may contribute to disparate incidence rates in some ethnic groups, especially for obesity and physical activity.

AB BACKGROUNDSea cucumber saponins (SCSs) exhibit a unique structure and high bioactivities and might have specialized implications on caffeine metabolic process by altering the activity of N-demethylation enzyme CYP1A2. The present study aimed to clarify the effects of SCS on caffeine metabolism in vivo and in vitro, as well as the synergistic anti-obesity effect of SCS and caffeine on high-fat diet-induced obese mice. RESULTSResults found that SCS administration significantly postponed the elimination rate of caffeine and its metabolites in vivo, and further study found CYP1A2-mediated caffeine metabolism was remarkably inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The synergistic effect of the SCS and caffeine combination could decrease the total weight of white adipose tissue by 52% compared with high-fat diet-treated group. CONCLUSIONSCS could prolong caffeine action time, and the combination of the two substances exhibited joint action on high-fat diet-induced obese mice. These findings might provide a basis for the development of functional foods and potential application using the combination of SCS and caffeine. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Consumption of sugary drinks is associated with the development of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases among children and adolescents. In addition to high added sugar content, many sugary drinks also contain caffeine. However, whether the combination of sugar and caffeine uniquely influences children's sugary drink intake is presently unknown. This study aimed to evaluate contextual factors surrounding children's sugary drink consumption and investigate reasons for sugary drink intake among children and adolescents, with a specific focus on caffeinated sodas and sweet tea. We also evaluated how sugary drink consumption makes children feel and how they anticipated that they would respond if sugary drinks were restricted. Focus group discussions (n = 9, 2-8 participants per group) were conducted with 37 predominantly AfricanAmerican children and adolescents, ages 8-14 years, who consumed >= 1 caffeine-containing sugary drink(s) daily, based on parental report. Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were independently coded by two coders, after which emergent themes were identified. Reported reasons for sugary drink consumption encompassed five themes: 1) perceived need (e.g., satisfy cravings, quench thirst); 2) physical and cognitive benefits (e.g., provide energy, improve attention); 3) emotional and interpersonal benefits (e.g., relieve anger, facilitate socializing); 4) sensory properties (e.g., taste, carbonation); and, 5) external cues (e.g., family/peer modeling, availability). Negative consequences resulting from excess intake were also reported, including gastrointestinal symptoms, headaches, fatigue, hyperactivity, and chronic disease. Perceived physical, cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal benefits encourage sugary drink consumption and exacerbate well-described challenges of sugary drink reduction, including their palatability, accessibility, and affordability. Findings also suggest that incorporation of strategies to enhance physical, cognitive, and emotional health may hold promise in reducing sugary drink consumption among children and adolescents.

AB Ingesting oolong tea or caffeine acutely increases energy expenditure, and oolong tea, but not caffeine, stimulates fat oxidation. The acute effects of caffeine, such as increased heart rate and interference with sleep, diminish over 1-4 days, known as caffeine tolerance. During each 14-day session of the present study, 12 non-obese males consumed oolong tea (100 mg caffeine, 21.4 mg gallic acid, 97 mg catechins and 125 mg polymerized polyphenol), caffeine (100 mg), or placebo at breakfast and lunch. On day 14 of each session, 24-h indirect calorimetry and polysomnographic sleep recording were performed. Caffeine and oolong tea increased fat oxidation by similar to 20% without affecting energy expenditure over 24-h. The decrease in the respiratory quotient by oolong tea was greater than that by caffeine during sleep. The effect of oolong tea on fat oxidation was salient in the post-absorptive state. These findings suggest a role of unidentified ingredients in oolong tea to stimulate fat oxidation, and this effect is partially suppressed in a postprandial state. Two weeks of caffeine or oolong tea ingestion increased fat oxidation without interfering with sleep. The effects of subacute ingestion of caffeine and oolong tea differed from the acute effects, which is a particularly important consideration regarding habitual tea consumption.

AB BACKGROUND Caffeine has an anti-obesity effect, although chronic excessive caffeine consumption also causes caffeinism, which is marked by increased anxiety or depression, amongst other symptoms. The present study aimed to investigate whether the addition of flavonoids such as astilbin can reduce the caffeine dose needed to inhibit obesity. RESULTS ICR mice (n= 80) were fed with normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), HFD supplemented with astilbin, caffeine, or astilbin + caffeine for 12 weeks. When diets supplemented with astilbin, 0.3 g kg(-1)diet caffeine had the same effect as 0.6 g kg(-1)diet caffeine alone, and 0.6 g kg(-1)diet caffeine combined with astilbin most effectively inhibited HFD-induced obesity. Astilbin improved the anti-obesity effects of caffeine on lipid accumulation via the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha(AMPK alpha). (i) Activated AMPK alpha decreased lipid biosynthesis by suppressing the activity or mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c and its target gene fatty acid synthase. (ii) Activated AMPK alpha also up-regulated lipolysis by enhancing the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and increasing the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase. (iii) Finally, activated AMPK alpha increased carnitine acyltransferase and acyl-CoA oxidase activities, which further promoted fatty acid beta-oxidation. CONCLUSION The results obtained in the present study indicate that astilbin may decrease the effective dose of caffeine needed for an anti-obesity effect and also suggest that it suppresses fat accumulation via the activation of AMPK.

AB Coffee effects on glucose homeostasis in obesity remain controversial. We investigated whether coffee mitigates the negative effects on glucose metabolism induced by a high-fat diet and the interrelationships with redox-inflammatory responses. Rats were treated with: control (CT-); coffee (CT +) 3.9 g of freeze-dried coffee/kg of diet; high-fat (HF-); or high-fat + coffee 3.9 g of freeze-dried coffee/kg of diet (HF +) diet. The high-fat diet increased weight gain, feed efficiency, HOMA beta, muscle and hepatic glycogen, intestinal CAT and SOD activity, hepatic protein (CARB) and lipid oxidation (MDA), muscle Prkaa1 mRNA and IL6 levels, and decreased food intake, hepatic GR, GPX and SOD activities, intestinal CARB, intestinal Slc2a2 and Slc5a1 and hepatic Prkaa1 and Prkaa2 mRNA levels, hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase and muscle hexokinase (HK) activities, compared to the control diet. The high-fat diet with coffee increased hepatic GST activity and TNF and decreased IL6 and intestinal glucosidase activity compared with the high-fat diet. The coffee diet increased muscle glycogen, hepatic CARB and PEPCK activity, and decreased hepatic GR and SOD activities and intestinal CARB, compared with the control diet. Coffee increased insulin levels, HOMA IR/beta, FRAP, muscle Prkaa1 mRNA levels and hepatic and muscle phosphofructokinase-1, and it decreased intestinal CAT, hepatic Slc2a2 mRNA levels and muscle HK activity, regardless of the diet type. In conclusion, chronic coffee consumption improves antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses, but does not ameliorate glucose homeostasis in a high-fat diet-induced obesity model. In addition, coffee consumption increases insulin secretion and promotes muscle glycogen synthesis in rats maintained on a control diet. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present work investigated the effect of a-lipoic acid (ALA) and caffeine-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CAF-CS NPs) on obesity and its hepatic and renal complications in rats. Rats were divided into control, rat model of obesity induced by high fat diet (HFD), and obese rats treated with ALA and/or CAF-CS NPs. At the end of the experiment, the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the levels of urea, creatinine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined in the sera of animals. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured in hepatic and renal tissues. Renal Na+, K+-ATPase was assessed. The histopathological changes were examined in the hepatic and renal tissues. Obese rats showed a significant increase in AST, ALT, ALP, urea, and creatinine. This was associated with a significant increase in IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, MDA, and NO. A significant decrease in hepatic and renal GSH and renal Na+, K+-ATPase activity was recorded in obese rats. Obese rats also showed histopathological alterations in hepatic and renal tissues. Treatment with ALA and/or CAF-CS NPs reduced the weight of obese rats and ameliorated almost all the hepatic and renal biochemical and histopathological changes induced in obese rats. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that ALA and/or CAF-CS NPs offered an effective therapy against obesity induced by HFD and its hepatic and renal complications. The therapeutic effect of ALA and CAF-CS NPs could be mediated through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

AB Metabolic syndrome (METS) is a complex disorder that predisposes an affected person to an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Bitter Asteraceae plants contain several compounds active against METS that can be used as an alternative preventive therapy. Our previous work showed that a natural chicory extract (NCRAE) containing chicoric acid (CRA) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) in a molar ratio of 70/30 exhibited an antioxidant, insulin sensitization and anti-hyperglycemic effect. The present study was designed to evaluate the preventive effects of an NCRAE-like extract against METS in a complementary natural pharmacotherapeutic approach. An original Asteraceae infused drink containing the NCRAE CRA/CGA molecular ratio equivalent was prepared from dandelion (Taraxacum officinale L.) and burdock (Arctium lappa L.). The anti-METS effect of this drink was evaluated on the fructose-rat model for 8 weeks. Body weight, blood biochemistry, hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase, arterial blood pressure glucose and insulin tolerance were evaluated after 8 weeks. Our results show that daily oral intake of the Asteraceae infused drink led to a reduction of body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance and hypertension. Moreover, rat-by-rat analysis of the insulinemia measures revealed two types of responders. One sub-group of subjects demonstrated normal insulinemia and the other subgroup demonstrated hyperinsulinemia. This hyperinsulinemia, associated with the inhibition of the glucose-6-phosphatase activity in the liver tissue, may suggest an insulin release caused by CGA. The present study suggests that this original infusion of dandelion leaves and burdock roots may be used as an adjuvant therapy to prevent metabolic syndrome.

AB BackgroundAlthough several studies have evaluated the association between patterns of beverage consumption with different components of quality of life separately, the findings are controversial. In addition, none have examined all components of quality of life together in relation to patterns of beverage consumption. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the association between healthy beverage index (HBI) and quality of life among overweight and obese women.MethodsFor this cross-sectional study, 210 obese and overweight women were recruited from health centers in Tehran, Iran. Using reliable and verified standard protocols, data on beverage intake, socio-demographic, physical activity, and anthropometric variables were assessed. Based on past studies, the predetermined HBI was estimated. Serum samples were used to determine biochemical characteristics, and quality of life was assessed using SF-36 questionnaires.ResultsThere was a significant association between total QoL score with T2 tertile of HBI in the adjusted model (beta: 13.11, 95% CI: 1.52, 24.69, p-value = 0.027). General health had a significant negative association with T2 (beta: -5.83; 95% CI: - 11.48, - 0.18; p-value = 0.043) and T3 (beta: -6.20; 95% CI: - 12.37, - 0.03; p-value = 0.049). Women with greater adherence to the HBI had a higher physical functioning score, and there was a significant upward trend from the second to the third tertile (7.74 vs 0.62) (-trend = 0.036). There was a significant positive association between mental health with T3 of HBI (beta: 4.26; 95% CI: 1.51, 5.98; p-value = 0.015) and a significant increasing trend was observed with increasing tertiles (P-trend = 0.045).ConclusionIn conclusion, there is a significant association between total QoL score, and its components, with HBI among overweight and obese women. However, additional well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AB PurposeSales for sugar-sweetened and caffeinated beverages are still rising globally and their consumption has been linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, direct evidence from human interventional studies in response to such beverages is still scarce. MethodsSeven young, non-obese men participated in a randomized crossover study where four test drinks [60 g sucrose + 50 mg caffeine, 60 g sucrose + caffeine-placebo, 50 mg caffeine, and caffeine-placebo] were investigated. Each drink was brought to a total volume of 500 mL with water. Continuous and beat-to-beat hemodynamic monitoring was conducted for 30 min baseline and continued for 90 min after the ingestion of each drink. Measurements included blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, index of contractility, and double product. ResultsTwo-factor ANOVA analysis revealed significant treatment-by-time effects for diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, index of contractility, and double product (all p < 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure and total peripheral resistance increased significantly to caffeine-only (all p < 0.05), while sucrose + caffeine-placebo and sucrose + caffeine both decreased resistance responses (all p < 0.05). Cardiac output increased significantly to sucrose + caffeine-placebo and sucrose + caffeine (all p < 0.05), and on trend for heart rate, stroke volume, and index of contractility (all p between 0.05 and 0.09). ConclusionIn young, non-obese men, a caffeinated and sucrose-sweetened beverage at concentrations similar to classical commercial Cola products exhibited distinct hemodynamic actions where the presence of sucrose dampened caffeine-induced blood pressure elevations, but at the expense of a tendency to increase cardiac work.

AB ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate the association between coffee consumption and frailty in older American adults. We focused on individuals at higher frailty risk, such as women, ethnic minorities, smokers, and those with obesity and insufficient physical activity. MethodsThe data of 8,087 individuals aged over 60 years from the 2007-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were used for this cross-sectional study. The coffee drinks were classified into two categories: caffeinated and decaffeinated. Frailty was measured using the 53-item frailty index. Weighted binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between coffee intake and frailty risk. Restricted cubic spline models were used to assess the dose-response relationship between caffeinated coffee intake and frailty. ResultsAmong the 8,087 participants, 2,458 (30.4%) had frailty. Compared with those who reported no coffee consumption, the odds ratios [ORs; 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] of total coffee consumption > 498.9 (g/day) were 0.65 (0.52, 0.79) in the fully adjusted model. Compared with those who reported no caffeinated coffee consumption, the ORs (95% CIs) of total coffee consumption > 488.4 (g/day) were 0.68 (0.54, 0.85) in the fully adjusted model. Compared with those who reported no decaffeinated coffee consumption, the ORs (95% CIs) of total coffee consumption > 0 (g/day) were 0.87 (0.71, 1.06) in the fully adjusted model. Nonlinear associations were detected between total coffee and caffeinated coffee consumption and frailty. In the subgroup analyses by smoking status, the association between coffee consumption and the risk of frailty was more pronounced in non-smokers (P for interaction = 0.031). ConclusionCaffeinated coffee consumption was independently and nonlinearly associated with frailty, especially in non-smokers. However, decaffeinated coffee consumption was not associated with frailty.

AB (Poly)phenol-rich diets have been associated with reduced risk of various diseases. Coffee and tea are typically identified as dietary sources of chlorogenic acid and flavan-3-ols; however, 100% fruit juice greatly contributes to anthocyanin, flavonol, flavan-3-ols, and flavanone intake, making them complementary sources of dietary (poly)phenols. Thus, the aim of this narrative review was to provide an overview of fruit (poly)phenols and their potential health benefits. Fruit (poly)phenols have been associated with several health benefits (eg, reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and neurocognitive benefits). Although perspectives on 100% fruit juice consumption are controversial due to the perception of sugar content, growing evidence supports the role of fruit in whole and 100% juice forms to provide consumer benefits in alignment with dietary guidance. However, differences in (poly)phenol profiles and bioavailability likely exist between whole fruit and 100% fruit juice due to processing and the presence/absence of fiber. Ongoing studies are better defining similarities and differences between whole fruit and 100% fruit juice to elucidate protective mechanisms and align with processing and consumer products.

AB Background/objectivesStudies have reported the health benefits of green coffee extract (GCE) in experimental models. In the current study, we aimed to determine whether supplementation with GCE improves glycemic indices, inflammation, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).Methods and study designThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 44 patients (26 male and 18 female) with T2D and overweight/obesity. After blocked randomization, patients received either capsules containing 400 mg GCE twice per day (n = 22) or a placebo (n = 22) and were followed for 10 weeks. In this study, glycemic indices, lipid profiles, anthropometric examinations, blood pressure, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured twice; at baseline and at the end of the study.ResultsAfter 10 weeks of supplementation, GCE supplementation significantly reduced body weight (p = 0.04) and body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.03) compared to the placebo. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis indicated patients in the GCE group had a lower fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration compared to the placebo group; however, this decreasing was marginally significant (8.48 +/- 8.41 vs. 1.70 +/- 5.82 mg/dL, p = 0.05). There was no significant difference in insulin levels and HOMA-IR between the groups. At the end of the study, significant changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p = 0.01), triglyceride (TG) level (p = 0.02), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p = 0.001), and TG-to-HDL ratio (p = 0.001) were found between the intervention and placebo groups. Our trial indicated GCE supplementation had no effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or total cholesterol. During the supplementation period, the hs-CRP level significantly decreased in the GCE group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.02). No significant changes were observed in the MDA level between the two groups at the end of the study (p = 0.54).ConclusionOur findings showed beneficial effects of GCE on SBP, TG, hs-CRP, and HDL levels in patients with T2D and overweight/obesity over a 10-week period of supplementation.Clinical trial registration:https://en.irct.ir/trial/48549, identifier [IRCT20090203001640N18].ConclusionOur findings showed beneficial effects of GCE on SBP, TG, hs-CRP, and HDL levels in patients with T2D and overweight/obesity over a 10-week period of supplementation.Clinical trial registration:https://en.irct.ir/trial/48549, identifier [IRCT20090203001640N18].

AB Previous studies revealed inconsistent results between coffee drinking and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between habitual coffee drinking and the prevalence of MetS among men and women. We conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional study using 23,073 adults obtained from the Taiwan Biobank database (mean +/- SD (range) age, 54.57 +/- 0.07 (30-79) years; 8341 men and 14,731 (63.8%) women). Adults who drank more than one cup of coffee per day (n = 5118) and those who drank less than one cup per day (n = 4515) were compared with nondrinkers (n = 13,439). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk of MetS between the two groups. Separate models were also estimated for sex-stratified and habitual coffee-type-stratified (black coffee (BC), coffee with creamer (CC), and coffee with milk (CM)) subgroup analyses. The MetS diagnosis was based on at least three of the five metabolic abnormalities. Coffee drinkers (>= 1 cup/day) had a significantly lower prevalence of MetS than nondrinkers (AOR (95% CI): 0.80 (0.73-0.87)). Women who drank any amount of coffee and any type of coffee were more likely to have a significantly lower prevalence of MetS than nondrinkers. Only men who drank more than one cup of coffee per day or black coffee drinkers were more likely to have a lower prevalence of MetS. Our study results indicate that adults with habitual coffee drinking behaviors of more than one cup per day were associated with a lower prevalence of MetS. Moreover, women could benefit from habitual coffee drinking of all three coffee types, whereas men could only benefit from drinking BC.

AB This study aimed to assess the impact of roasting degree on antioxidant and metabolic parameters in vitro and in vivo. . In vitro, , we evaluated radical scavenging, lipid peroxidation, and the activity of digestive enzymes (alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and lipase). In vivo, , we first examined coffee's effect on carbohydrate and lipid absorption in healthy rats, followed by a chronic evaluation of metabolic disorders and antioxidant markers using a diet-induced obesity model. In vitro results revealed that increased roasting degree reduced the antioxidant capacity of coffee brews. All brews showed lower inhibition of alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, and lipase inhibition compared to the positive control (acarbose or orlistat). In vivo, , all roasting degrees consistently reduced postprandial glucose levels by 20%. Notably, coffee with a high roasting degree (HRD) decreased serum triglycerides (TG) by similar to 44% after a lipid load, while other roasts did not. Chronic administration of unroasted (UN) or HRD coffee significantly reduced weight gain compared to the obese control (similar to 15% and similar to 10%, respectively). Notably, all coffee samples improved lipid metabolism parameters. UN and HRD coffee significantly decreased adipocyte volume by 58% and 48%, respectively, compared to the obese control. Additionally, all groups exhibited less than 30% hepatic lipid droplets independent of roasting degree. HRD treatment notably increased liver catalase (CAT) activity and reduced lipid peroxidation in serum (similar to 90%), liver (similar to 59%), and adipose tissue (similar to 37%) compared to the obese control group. These findings suggest that HRD in coffee may confer certain biological advantages.

AB BackgroundMetabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors is influenced by environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors. We explored whether coffee consumption and the rs301 variant of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene are related to MetS.MethodsWe conducted multiple logistic regression analyses using data gathered from 9523 subjects in Taiwan Biobank (TWB).ResultsOur findings indicated that individuals who consumed coffee had a reduced odds ratio (OR) for MetS (0.750 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.653-0.861) compared to non-coffee drinkers. Additionally, the risk of MetS was lower for individuals with the 'TC' and 'CC' genotypes of rs301 compared to those with the 'TT' genotype. Specifically, the OR for MetS was 0.827 (95% CI 0.721-0.949) for the 'TC' genotype and 0.848 (95% CI 0.610-1.177) for the 'CC' genotype. We observed an interaction between coffee consumption and the rs301 variant, with a p-value for the interaction of 0.0437. Compared to the reference group ('no coffee drinking/TT'), the ORs for MetS were 0.836 (95% CI 0.706-0.992) for 'coffee drinking/TT', 0.557 (95% CI 0.438-0.707) for 'coffee drinking/TC', and 0.544 (95% CI 0.319-0.927) for 'coffee drinking/CC'. Notably, MetS was not observed in non-coffee drinkers regardless of their rs301 genotype.ConclusionOur findings suggest that rs301 genotypes may protect against MetS in Taiwanese adults who consume coffee compared to non-coffee drinkers.

AB Background & aims: Population-based studies have suggested a protective effect of coffee against development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), possibly through coffee's anti-inflammatory and antiox-idant compounds. Studies on coffee and kidney function decline in the general population are scarce. We studied associations of habitual coffee consumption with repeated assessments of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR).Methods: We used data from 7,914 participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study. Baseline coffee consumption data (cups/day) were obtained from home interviews and validated food frequency questionnaires (1997-20 08). Repeated assessments of eGFR (ml/min per 1.73 m2, 1997-2014) were calculated according to the creatinine-based CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation of 2012. Repeated assessments of urinary albumin and creatinine were used to estimate ACR (mg/g, 2006-2014). Data were analyzed by applying linear mixed models, adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary factors, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Predefined subgroup analyses were performed stratified by CKD risk factors.Results: Participants' mean (SD) baseline age was 66 (10) years, 57% were women and median [IQR] coffee consumption was 3.0 [2.0, 5.0] cups/day. Those drinking more coffee were more likely to smoke, and to have type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Mean eGFR was 79 (15) ml/min per 1.73 m2. In the total study population, coffee was not associated with longitudinal eGFR during a median of 5.4 years of follow-up (b = 0.04 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per one cup/day [95% CI:-0.10,0.18]). However, among those aged >70 years, one additional coffee cup/day was associated with on average 0.84 (0.51,1.18) ml/min per 1.73 m2 higher longitudinal eGFR. Among obese participants this estimate was 0.32 (0.01,0.63). A pro-tective trend was also observed among former smokers (0.17 [-0.03,0.39]) and those with T2D (0.42 [-0.05,0.88]). Coffee was not associated with longitudinal ACR (0.01 mg/ml [-0.01,0.02]).Conclusion: While coffee was not associated with eGFR and ACR in the total population, more coffee consumption was associated with higher longitudinal eGFR among those at higher risk for CKD, i.e., among those aged 70+ and obese participants. These findings require confirmation in other prospective cohort studies.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: In genome-wide association studies, the HECT domain E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 4 (HECTD4) gene was suggested to be associated with obesity-related traits and coffee consumption. However, the association of genetic variants between coffee consumption and obesity has not been tested in Koreans. Therefore, we investigated whether HECTD4 gene variants act as effect modifiers on the relationship between obesity and coffee. Methods: This study analyzed the correlation between coffee consumption and obesity among 58,698 individuals representing the Health Examinees. Participants were categorized into obese (BMI >= 25.0 kg/m(2)) and nonobese (18.5 <= BMI < 23.0 kg/m(2)). Food consumption was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Results: We identified four HECTD4 gene variants associated with obesity-related traits and coffee consumption based on Bonferroni-corrected significance level (p < 0.00014). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that the impact of coffee consumption on obesity differed based on the HECTD4 rs2074356 genotypes. A positive correlation between obesity and coffee consumption was observed, with a more pronounced effect in individuals with the G allele (OR = 1.61 for 1 to <2 cups/day, p = 1.89 x 10(-37); OR = 1.82 for >= 2 cups/day, p = 1.73 x 10(-42)) than in those with the A allele (OR = 1.47 for 1 to <2 cups/day, p = 7.41 x 10(-17); OR = 1.45 for >= 2 cups/day, p = 7.24 x 10(-11)). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the influence of coffee consumption on obesity may vary in Koreans depending on the HECTD4 gene variant.

AB Background Biological and epidemiological evidence supports an inverse association of phenolic acids with obesity-related chronic diseases. However, no previous study has prospectively evaluated the relationship between subclasses and individual compounds of phenolic acids and the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, one of the most important and prevalent obesity-related cancer sites.
   Objective This study examined associations between subclasses of phenolic acids, including hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids intake, and risk of breast cancer.
   Design The Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Project is a dynamic, permanently open prospective cohort which started in 1999.
   Participants/setting Participants were 10,812 middle-aged women. All of them were university graduates.
   Main outcome measures Usual diet was assessed at baseline and after 10 years of follow-up with a 136-item food frequency questionnaire. Phenolic acid intake was calculated by matching food consumption with the Phenol-Explorer database on phenolic acids content of each reported food item.
   Statistical analysis performed Participants were classified according to tertiles of subclasses or individual compounds of phenolic acids. Cox regression models were fitted to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs for breast cancer incidence.
   Results Over an average of 11.8 years of follow-up, 101 incident cases of breast cancer were confirmed. After multivariable adjustment, an inverse association between hydroxycinnamic acids intake and breast cancer was observed (hazard ratio third tertile vs first tertile 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.85; P for trend=0.029) among postmenopausal women. Specifically, chlorogenic acids (3-, 4-, and 5-caffeoylquinic acids) showed the strongest inverse association (hazard ratio third tertile vs first tertile 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78; P for trend=0.012).
   Conclusions A higher intake of hydroxycinnamic acids, especially from chlorogenic acids-present in coffee, fruits, and vegetables-was associated with a lower incidence of breast cancer among postmenopausal women. Future observational studies are needed to corroborate these results.

AB Background: This study investigates the associations between coffee consumption and metabolic syndrome and its components, as well as the effect of milk, sugar, and artificial sweeteners on these associations. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with 351805 UK Biobank participants. Coffee consumption data were collected via food frequency questionnaires and 24-h recall. Metabolic syndrome was identified through blood biochemistry and self-reported medication use. Odds ratios were calculated using multivariable logistic regression, and results were verified with two-sample Mendelian randomization. Results: Consuming up to two cups of coffee per day was inversely associated with metabolic syndrome (1 cup/day: odds ratio [OR]: 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.92; 2 cups/day: OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93). Higher intakes showed near-null associations. Mendelian randomization did not support a causal link between coffee intake and metabolic syndrome. Both self-reported and genetically predicted high coffee consumption (four cups per day or more) were associated with central obesity. The inverse association between coffee consumption and metabolic syndrome was more profound among drinkers of ground coffee than those of instant coffee. Results were similar when stratified by the use of milk and sugar, yet the use of artificial sweetener with coffee was positively associated with metabolic syndrome and all component conditions. Conclusions: Coffee consumption may increase the risk of central obesity but is unlikely to impact the risk of metabolic syndrome. The potential health effects of artificial sweeteners in coffee need further investigation.

AB This systematic review aimed to study caffeine's effect on the cardiometabolic markers of the metabolic syndrome and to evaluate caffeine's application as a potential therapeutic agent in rat models. The systematic review was structured and synthesized according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the Population, Intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) framework. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect to identify studies that used caffeine as an intervention in the rat model of the metabolic syndrome or any of its components compared with no treatment or controls. Studies that did not mention the disease manifestations from the experimental model used, without rat subjects, and which induced renovascular hypertension were excluded. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk-of-bias tool. The main outcomes assessed were caffeine's effect on obesity, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, hepatic dysfunction, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Out of 228 studies retrieved from the search, 18 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Caffeine was found to favorably reduce obesity and insulin resistance in the rat model of the metabolic syndrome. The effects of caffeine on dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, hepatic dysfunction, and hypertension remain inconclusive. The main limitations of this study are the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of the disease model used, experimental duration, methods to assess outcomes, including studies that were only published in English, measurement units used, and graphical data without and numerical mention in the results section. As a result, quantitative synthesis was unfeasible, and a qualitative descriptive synthesis was conducted; this might have led to the under characterization of caffeine's effect on metabolic syndrome and its potential as an adjuvant therapy in metabolic syndrome. Caffeine has favorable effects on the metabolic syndrome, chiefly reducing obesity and insulin resistance. Future research is encouraged to delve into caffeine's effect on dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, hepatic dysfunction, and hypertension, which is necessary if caffeine is to be used as a potential clinical adjuvant therapy to treat the metabolic syndrome.

AB The plant Santa herba (Eriodictyon californicum) contains high flavonoids, thus potentially exerting beneficial effects in context of obesity, often accompanied by inflammation and metabolic imbalance. The study assessed the impact of Santa herba on oxidative stress, energy metabolism, weight reduction, and eating behavior, combining in vitro models with clinical data. Santa herba binding of the adenosine receptor A2A (ADORA2A) was assessed using a radioligand binding assay. A Caenorhabditis elegans model was used to determine mobility boosting effects, and Santa herba oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values were determined in comparison to antioxidative plants. Clinical data, that is, body weight and appetite-related parameters, were obtained from overweight and obese women receiving either Santa herba or placebo for 12 weeks. Results showed that Santa herba extract binds to ADORA2A, stimulates C. elegans motility (+7.5%) and locomotion, and yields high antioxidative capacities (ORAC: 819 trolox equivalent). Clinical data, obtained from 24 overweight and 25 obese women (mean: 47.5 years), demonstrated a reduced body weight (P = .042) and body fat (P = .044), and by trend reduced leptin levels (P = .065) in women with obesity after Santa herba consumption compared to placebo. In conclusion, Santa herba extract has energizing and antioxidative properties and may aid in weight management of people with obesity. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03853603.

AB Sedentary time is associated with increased obesity in police officers. Caffeine intake may reduce sedentary time but it has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, the effect of caffeine ingestion on sedentary time was investigated in obese police officers. Fourteen obese police officers ingested either 5 mg/kg of caffeine or cellulose (placebo) for six days. Information on inactivity time, time spent with physical activities, self-reported perception of tiredness, and physical activity disposition was obtained daily during the intervention period. Sedentary and physical activity times were divided into two intraday periods (T-1: 08:00 am-02:00 pm and T-2: 02:00 pm-08:00 pm). Caffeine intake decreased the sedentary time in both T-1 (79.2 +/- 2.2%) and T-2 (79.1 +/- 2.5%), when compared with T-2 of the placebo condition (81.1 +/- 3.6%, P<0.05). Caffeine intake also increased the time spent on light physical activities in T-1 and T-2 (17 +/- 2 and 18 +/- 2%), when compared with T-2 of the placebo condition (16 +/- 3%, P<0.05). In addition, sedentary time increased and light physical activity time decreased from T-1 to T-2 in the placebo (P<0.001) but not in the caffeine condition (P=0.81). Caffeine intake had no effect on tiredness (P>0.05), but it increased the self-reported physical activity disposition compared to the placebo condition (4.5 +/- 2.7 vs 3.2 +/- 2.3 units, P<0.05). Caffeine intake reduced the sedentary time and increased the time spent on light physical activities of obese police officers, which seems to be related to a higher disposition for the practice of physical activity.

AB Scope Large-leaf yellow tea (YT) exhibits interesting beneficial metabolic effects in previous studies. Here, the authors elucidated the actions of YT on thermogenesis, energy metabolism, and adipocyte metabolic conversion.
   Methods and Results Five-week-old male C57BL/6 mice are fed low-fat diet, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD supplemented with 0.5% or 2.5% YT. After treatment for 10 or 14 weeks, YT enhances energy expenditure, O-2 consumption and CO2 production. YT strongly boosts thermogenic program in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), while only weakly in epididymal adipose tissue (EAT). These are accompanied by higher body temperature, increased mitochondrial copy numbers, and upregulation of thermogenic genes (Ucp1, Pgc1 alpha, etc.) and proteins. The classic brown adipocyte markers (Eva1, Zic1) are induced only in BAT, while beige adipocyte markers (Tbx1, Tmem26) are boosted only in SAT. Furthermore, subcutaneous-originated preadipocytes are induced by YT in vitro to differentiate to brown-like adipocytes - a browning effect.
   Conclusion Dietary YT induces adaptive thermogenesis through increasing mitochondrial biogenesis in EAT, inducing beigeing in SAT and enhancing browning in the BAT.

AB Legumes are a rich source of polyphenolic compounds known for their ability to promote health. Under stress conditions, legumes have been shown to produce higher levels of secondary metabolites, as a defensive mechanism. Hence, the present study aimed to induce legume seeds (e.g., soybean, chickpea, green pea, and red kidney bean) by inoculating them with Aspergillus sojae (A. sojae) and to evaluate the extracts for phytoalexins, phenolics, and antioxidant, antiobesity, and antidiabetic potentials. The UPLC-DAD findings of A. sojae-induced legumes showed medicarpin and maackiain in chickpea, pisatin in green pea, glyceollin I-III in soybean, and kievitone and phaseollin in red kidney bean. All induced legumes exhibited a higher total polyphenol content compared to the non-induced ones. Among induced legumes, soybean exhibited a higher (4.85 mg GAE/g) polyphenol content. The UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS findings established that legumes contained substantial levels of protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, coumaric acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and caffeic acid. The results of antioxidant assays revealed a significantly higher level of activity in induced red kidney bean and soybean, whereas the level of activity in non-induced legumes was markedly lower. Moreover, induced red kidney bean effectively inhibited alpha-glucosidase (87.2%) and alpha-amylase (63.90%) at 5 mg/mL. Additionally, the maximum lipase inhibitory effects were displayed by induced soybean (72.54%) at 20 mg/mL.

AB Commercial environments and food acquisition methods significantly shape dietary practices and impact health. This study assesses dietary choices among Portuguese university students regarding vending machines, canteens, and lunches from home. It also evaluates their use of the university canteen and their tendency to bring lunch from home. This pilot cross-sectional study used a self-administered electronic questionnaire, made available in early 2023. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling. The study included 137 students from Portuguese higher education institutions, mainly women (74.5%), pursuing degrees or integrated Master's degrees (83.2%), primarily in health-related fields (55.5%). The median age was 21 years (20 to 23.5 years). About 70.0% regularly consumed food from vending machines, while approximately 60.0% brought lunch from home, avoiding the canteen. Factors such as convenience (48.5%), price (47.5%), product availability (40.6%), and taste (39.6%) mainly influenced vending machine choices. Monthly, chocolates, water, coffee, cookies, treats, and soft drinks were the most commonly acquired items, with coffee being the most frequent daily purchase. These findings provide insights for creating policies and initiatives to promote healthier and more accessible food options for students and strategies to encourage positive eating behaviors.

AB Coffee brewing produces spent coffee grounds as waste; few studies have investigated the health benefits of these grounds. This study investigated responses to spent coffee grounds in a diet-induced rat model of metabolic syndrome. Male Wistar rats aged 8-9 weeks were fed either corn starch-rich diet or high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet for 16 weeks, which were supplemented with 5% spent coffee grounds during the last 8 weeks. Rats fed non-supplemented diets were used as controls. High-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-fed rats developed metabolic syndrome including abdominal obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular and liver damage. Body weight, abdominal fat, total body fat mass, systolic blood pressure, and concentrations of plasma triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids were reduced by spent coffee grounds along with improved glucose tolerance and structure and function of heart and liver. Spent coffee grounds increased the diversity of the gut microbiota and decreased the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. Changes in gut microbiota correlated with the reduction in obesity and improvement in glucose tolerance and systolic blood pressure. These findings indicate that intervention with spent coffee grounds may be useful for managing obesity and metabolic syndrome by altering the gut microbiota, thus increasing the value of this food waste.

AB Background Moderate caffeine intake decreases the risk of metabolic disorders and all-cause mortality, and the mechanism may be related to its ergogenic actions. Thyroid hormones are vital in metabolic homeostasis; however, their association with caffeine intake has rarely been explored. Objective To investigate the association between caffeine intake and thyroid function. Methods We collected data on demographic background, medical conditions, dietary intake, and thyroid function from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2012. Subgroups were classified using two-step cluster analysis, with sex, age, body mass index (BMI), hyperglycemia, hypertension, and cardio-cerebral vascular disease (CVD) being used for clustering. Restrictive cubic spline analysis was employed to investigate potential nonlinear correlations, and multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the association between caffeine consumption and thyroid function. ResultsA total of 2,582 participants were included, and three subgroups with different metabolic features were clustered. In the most metabolically unhealthy group, with the oldest age, highest BMI, and more cases of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and CVD, there was a nonlinear relationship between caffeine intake and serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level. After adjusting for age, sex, race, drinking, smoking, medical conditions, and micronutrient and macronutrient intake, caffeine intake of less than 9.97 mg/d was positively associated with serum TSH (p = 0.035, standardized beta = 0.155); however, moderate caffeine consumption (9.97-264.97 mg/d) indicated a negative association (p = 0.001, standardized beta = - 0.152). Conclusions Caffeine consumption had a nonlinear relationship with serum TSH in people with metabolic disorders, and moderate caffeine intake (9.97 similar to 264.97 mg/d) was positively associated with serum TSH.

AB Obesity is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases and affects the overall quality of life. Gardenia jasminoides (Ellis) fruit (GE) and Eucommia ulmoides leaves (EE) are traditional medicines reported to possess antioxidative, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-obesity activities. However, the synergistic effect of combining Gardenia and Eucommia remains unclear. This study aimed to test the combination via animal and cell experiments. GE extract mainly contains geniposide (52.5 %), whereas EE extract contains crocin (10.5 %) and chlorogenic acid (52.3 %). Copper soap analysis revealed that the combination of GE and EE induced greater pancreatic lipase activity. In C57BL/6J mice, this combination markedly improved hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia in intravenous fat and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, respectively. In HepG2 cells with hyperlipidemia induced via oleic acid (OA), GE + EE reduced the accumulation of ectopic lipid and augmented the oxidative stress-related enzyme activities by elevating PPAR alpha, AMPK, Nrf2, and HO-1 expression and attenuating Keap-1 expression. Thus, this combination protects against OA-induced lipid toxicity by targeting AMPK-PPAR alpha and Nrf2- Keap-1-HO-1.

AB This study was performed to investigate the association between coffee consumption and risk of colorectal cancer in a Korean population and examine whether the association can be altered by adjustment for intake of coffee additives. We conducted a case-control study involving 923 colorectal cancer cases and 1846 controls matched by sex and age (within 5 years). A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess coffee intakes. High coffee consumption was associated with lower odds of developing colorectal cancer (>= 3 cups/day vs. no drinks, OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49-0.96). When we additionally controlled for consumption of coffee additives including sugar and cream, the inverse association became stronger (>= 3 cups/day vs. no drinks, OR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.14-0.33), and a significant inverse linear trend was shown (P-trend < 0.0001). The inverse associations were observed for proximal (P-trend = 0.0001) and distal (P-trend = 0.0003) colon cancer, and rectal cancer (P-trend < 0.0001) in the stratified analysis by anatomical sub-sites. Regarding sex, inverse associations between coffee consumption and colorectal cancer were found for men (P-trend < 0.0001) and women (P-trend = 0.0021). In the stratified analysis by obese status of subjects, inverse linear trends were observed in both non-obese and obese people (P-trend < 0.0001). High coffee consumption may be associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in the Korean population and the degree of decrease in the odds of developing colorectal cancer changes by adjustment for intake of coffee additives.

AB Objective: To establish an efficacious and efficient fermentation method of enhancing the anti-adipogenesis effect of mulberry (Morus alba) leaves using Cordyceps militais. Methods: Dried mulberry leaves, dried mulberry leaves with 50% raw silkworm pupa and raw silkworm pupa were fermented with Cordyceps militais for 4 weeks at 25 degrees C, after which the dried mulberry leaves and fermented product were extracted with 70% ethanol and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The contents of cordycepin, pelargonidin, chlorogenic acid, iso-quercetin and caffeic acid were determined. We then used the 3T3-L1 cells to investigate whether extracts of fermentation enhanced anti-adipogenesis activity in vitro. Results: HPLC showed that fermentation changed the contents of cordycepin, pelargonidin, chlorogenic acid, iso-quercetin and caffeic acid. Furthermore, fermented dried mulberry leaves with 50% raw silkworm pupa had a better efficacy of anti-adipogenesis than dried mulberry leaves, fermented dried mulberry leaves and fermented silkworm pupa and inhibited triglycerides accumulation and glucose consumption. Additionally, fermented dried mulberry leaves with 50% raw silkworm pupa inhibited PPAR-gamma signaling. Conclusions: Fermentation with Cordyceps militaris enhanced anti-adipogenesis efficacy of mulberry leaves.

AB BackgroundGreen tea (GT) is a common component of supplements known as fat burners. It has gained popularity as an ergogenic aid for weight reduction to assist with obesity management. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to explore the effect of green tea ingestion coupled with exercise training (EX) on body composition and lipid profile in overweight and obese individuals.MethodsTwo independent researchers systematically searched the electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Studies with a randomized-controlled design to compare the effect of green tea in conjunction with exercise training (EX+GT) versus exercise training alone (EX+P) in overweight or obese participants were included.ResultsOf the 1,015 retrieved studies, 24 were identified to undergo full-text review, out of which 10 randomized trials met the inclusion criteria. EX+GT versus EX+P had a small and consistent effect on weight [Standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.30, CI: -0.53 to -0.07], BMI [SMD = -0.33 CI: -0.64 to -0.02] and fat reduction [SMD = -0.29, CI: -0.57 to -0.01] and there was no evidence of heterogeneity across the trials. When compared to EX+P, EX+GT had no greater effect on lipid profile improvement [triglyceride: SMD = -0.92, CI: -1.30 to 0.49; LDL: SMD = -1.44, CI: -0.73 to 0.82; HDL: SMD = 0.56, CI -0.71 to 0.46; and total cholesterol SMD = -0.54, CI -0.85 to 0.13].ConclusionsCurrent evidence suggests that green tea could have quite minimal additive benefit over exercise-induced weight loss. However, incorporation of green tea into exercise training does not seem to exert additional benefits on lipid profile and it warrants further investigations in the future.

AB Featured Application This study presents a comprehensive and stepwise strategy for utilizing coffee by-products as a sustainable source to develop bioactive food ingredients and nutraceuticals. Coffee by-products can be transformed into versatile functional food ingredients and nutraceuticals by implementing green extraction techniques and employing a biorefinery approach. These products offer a wide range of benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects, as well as the potential to regulate energy metabolism and blood sugar levels and serve as adjunct therapies for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. This research not only contributes to the creation of functional food products and supplements but also promotes sustainability and addresses the prevention and management of chronic diseases. Coffee production generates significant amounts of by-products, posing challenges for waste management in the industry. Recent research has revealed that coffee by-products are rich in bioactive compounds suitable to produce functional food ingredients and nutraceuticals. In this review, we explore biorefinery strategies for extracting and utilizing bioactive compounds from coffee by-products, including the production of bio-based chemicals and materials, as well as the extraction of phenolic compounds, antioxidants, and dietary fiber for food applications. We propose a stepwise approach for the development of functional food ingredients and nutraceuticals from coffee by-products, covering the identification of needs, comprehensive characterization, in vitro and in vivo research, unraveling the mechanism of action, food and nutraceutical formulation, sensory analysis, shelf-life stability, scale-up, randomized control trials, and biostatistics and bioinformatic integration. Additionally, we discuss the market potential, regulatory issues, and technological innovation surrounding the commercialization of coffee by-product-based products. Emphasizing the importance of regulatory compliance and sustainability in the coffee industry, this review highlights the potential of coffee by-products to be transformed from waste into valuable functional food ingredients and nutraceuticals, offering a promising avenue for waste reduction and promoting sustainability in the coffee industry.

AB We aimed to analyze the relationship between coffee, tea, and carbonated beverages and cardiovascular risk factors. We used data from the fourth to eighth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2007-2016, 2019-2020). We categorized the frequency of intake into three groups (<1 time/week, 1 time/week to <1 time/day, and >= 1 time/day). Subsequently, logistic regression analyses by sex were performed to assess cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia (DL), or metabolic syndrome (MetS)) according to the frequency of coffee, tea, and carbonated beverage intake. For HTN, coffee intake showed an inverse relationship and tea intake showed a direct relationship. For DM, coffee intake showed an inverse relationship, and tea and carbonated beverage intake showed a direct relationship. For DL, coffee intake showed an inverse relationship, whereas tea intake demonstrated a direct relationship. In addition, carbonated beverage intake showed a direct relationship with MetS. Coffee intake showed an inverse relationship with HTN, DM, and DL. However, tea intake showed a direct relationship with HTN, DM, and DL, whereas carbonated beverage intake showed a direct relationship with DM and MetS.

AB Objective. - To study the association between breakfast consumption and obesity.Materials and methods. - A cross-sectional study was conducted among 284 Algerian adults. The breakfast consumption and composition were assessed by the 24-hour recall repeated on three times. Breakfast consumers were defined as having consumed 300 Kcal and more in this meal. Anthropometric measurements included weight and height.Results. - Our population counts 46.5% men and 53.5% women. A total of 62.3% of adults were overweight, including 25.4% having obesity. Over half of the population (54.2%) ate breakfast. It usually consisted of a cereal product, a dairy product and a sweet product accompanied by coffee or tea. No significant difference was observed between the prevalence of obesity in breakfast consumers and non-consumers. No correlation was found between BMI and energy intake at breakfast. Non-consumers of breakfast had a higher total energy intake excluding breakfast than breakfast consumers. Conclusion. - In our study, skipping breakfast does not appear to be related to obesity. Rather, it appears to be related to an excess in total energy. & COPY; 2023 Socie & PRIME;te & PRIME; fran-cophone nutrition clinique et me & PRIME;tabolisme (SFNCM).

AB Although the effects of coffee consumption and physical exercise on the risk of cancer have been suggested, their interactions have not been investigated. The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the correlation of coffee consumption and physical exercise with cancer. Participants >= 40 years old in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study 2004-2016 were included (n = 162,220). Histories of gastric cancer, hepatic cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, uterine cervix cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, and bladder cancer were analyzed according to the coffee consumption groups using logistic regression models. The odds among individuals in the >60 cups/month coffee group were lower for gastric cancer (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.80 (95% confidence intervals = 0.65-0.98)), hepatic cancer (0.32 (0.18-0.58)), colon cancer (0.53 (0.39-0.72)), breast cancer (0.56 (0.45-0.70)), and thyroid cancer (0.71 (0.59-0.85)) than for individuals in the no coffee group. Physical exercise of >= 150 min/week was correlated with higher odds for gastric cancer (1.18 (1.03-1.36)), colon cancer (1.52 (1.26-1.83)), breast cancer (1.53 (1.35-1.74)), thyroid cancer (1.42 (1.27-1.59)), and prostate cancer (1.61 (1.13-2.28)) compared to no exercise. Coffee consumption and physical exercise showed an interaction in thyroid cancer (p = 0.002). Coffee consumption was related to a decreased risk of gastric cancer, hepatic cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer in the adult population. Physical exercise was positively correlated with gastric cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and prostate cancer.

AB Metabolic disorders (MDs) include disease states such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, etc., affecting about 30% of the planet's population. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the protective potential of Cicerbita alpina leaf extract (ECA) against chemically induced type 2 diabetes in Wistar rats. Additionally, some biochemical parameters in the blood serum and liver, as well as histopathological investigation, were also performed. Quantitative analysis of the major compounds in the used extract was performed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (UHPLC-DAD) analyses using the external standard method. C. alpina extract revealed a beneficial effect on MDs, lowering blood sugar levels and MDA quantity in the liver, increasing the reduced glutathione level, and increasing antioxidant enzyme activity. Cichoric acid (CA) (91.93 mg/g dry extract (de) +/- 4.64 mg/g de) was found to be the dominant compound in the extract, followed by caftaric (11.36 +/- 2.10 mg/g de), and chlorogenic acid (CGA) (9.25 +/- 0.05 mg/g de). In conclusion, C. alpina leaf extract (ECA) is rich in caffeoyltartaric and caffeoylquinic acids and provides beneficial effects on the diabetic animal model.

AB Background: The research is aimed at exploring the potential of marigold petal tea (MPT), rich in polyphenol contents, against oxidative stress and obesity in a rat model following a high-fat-sugar diet (HFSD).Methods: The MPT was prepared through the customary method of decoction and was subjected to analysis for its polyphenol composition using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Two specific doses of MPT, namely, 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight (BW), were chosen for the study-referred to as MPT-250 and MPT-500, respectively.Result: The main phenolic acids and flavonoids identified in MPT, with concentrations exceeding 10 mg/100 mL of tea, included catechin, rutin, salicylic acid, gallic acid, sinapic acid, chlorogenic acid, cinnamic acid, and ellagic acid. The total phenolic (TP) and total flavonoid (TF) contents in MPT were measured to be 5.53 and 7.73 mg/g, respectively. Additionally, MPT demonstrated a 57.2% scavenging capacity with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical. Notably, the administration of a higher dose (MPT-500) showed a significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) and a 51.24% reduction in the rate of increase in BW compared to the HFSD group. The findings indicated that all the treatment groups, that is, orlistat treatment (OT), MPT-250, and MPT-500 groups, experienced reduced levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and markers of lipoproteins in contrast to the HFSD group. Moreover, MPT helped restore the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione (GSH), thereby demonstrating its potential in combating oxidative stress. The MPT-500 group also displayed decreased liver and kidney weights and an improved atherogenic index when compared to the HFSD group.Conclusion: The results clearly indicate that a high dosage of MPT showed antiobesity activity which was comparable to the same effects produced by the conventional drug orlistat.

AB Plants from the Ilex genus are known for properties such as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, can act as antiobesity agents and thus can be helpful in medicine. Some holly species, such as Ilex paraguariensis (widely known in the form of popular beverage: yerba mate), have been investigated, while others have been partially researched or remain unknown. Therefore, we performed qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analyses and screened antimicrobial properties of lesser-studied species (I. aquifolium L., I. aquifolium 'Argentea Marginata' and I. x meserveae 'Blue Angel'). I. paraguariensis was used as a standard species for comparison purposes. Investigations were performed on water extracts due to their expected activity and composition. Antimicrobial research included evaluating minimal inhibitory, bactericidal (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and fungicidal concentration (Candida albicans, Alternaria alternata, Fusarium oxysporum, and Aspergillus niger) of extracts. The influence of the extracts on the production, eradication, and viability of bacterial biofilms was also analysed. It was established that Ilex paraguariensis possesses the richest profile of hydroxycinnamic acids derivatives in terms of component concentration and diversity. Ilex spp., especially I. x meserveae, contain a slightly higher amount of flavonoids and more different flavonoid derivatives than I. paraguariensis. However, the strongest antibacterial activity was shown by I. aquifolium L. and its cultivar 'Argentea Marginata' in terms of minimal inhibitory, bactericidal and fungicidal concentration, and biofilm assays. Extracts from both species significantly reduced the biofilm viability of S. aureus as well, which may be of use in the production of multicomponent lavaseptics, antiseptics, diuretics (supporting urinary tract infection therapy) and, due to their action on fungi, additives to growth media for specific fungi. The significant content of saponins enables Ilex extracts to be used as natural emulsifiers, for example, in cosmetics. Moreover, relatively high chlorogenic acid and rutin content may suggest use of Ilex spp. to treat obesity, digestive problems, in chemoprevention, and as preservatives in the food industry.

AB Lipid metabolism dysregulation can lead to dyslipidemia and obesity, which are major causes of cardiovascular disease and associated mortality worldwide. The purpose of the study was to obtain and characterize six plant extracts (ACE-Allii cepae extractum; RSE-Rosmarini extractum; CHE-Cichorii extractum; CE-Cynarae extractum; AGE-Apii graveolentis extractum; CGE-Crataegi extractum) as promising adjuvant therapies for the prevention and treatment of dyslipidemia and its related metabolic diseases. Phytochemical screening revealed that RSE was the richest extract in total polyphenols (39.62 +/- 13.16 g tannic acid/100 g dry extract) and phenolcarboxylic acids (22.05 +/- 1.31 g chlorogenic acid/100 g dry extract). Moreover, the spectrophotometric chemical profile highlighted a significant concentration of flavones for CGE (5.32 +/- 0.26 g rutoside/100 g dry extract), in contrast to the other extracts. UHPLC-MS quantification detected considerable amounts of phenolic constituents, especially chlorogenic acid in CGE (187.435 +/- 1.96 mg/g extract) and rosmarinic acid in RSE (317.100 +/- 2.70 mg/g extract). Rosemary and hawthorn extracts showed significantly stronger free radical scavenging activity compared to the other plant extracts (p < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis and the heatmap correlation matrix indicated significant correlations between phytochemical contents and in vitro antioxidant activities. Computational studies were performed to investigate the potential anti-obesity mechanism of the studied extracts using target prediction, homology modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics approaches. Our study revealed that rosmarinic acid (RA) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) can form stable complexes with the active site of carbonic anhydrase 5A by either interacting with the zinc-bound catalytic water molecule or by directly binding Zn2+. Further studies are warranted to experimentally validate the predicted CA5A inhibitory activities of RA and CGA and to investigate the hypolipidemic and antioxidant activities of the proposed plant extracts in animal models of dyslipidemia and obesity.

TI Tropical fruits from Australia as potential treatments for metabolic

AB Australia has a unique and diverse flora, including indigenous fruits, used by Australian Aboriginals for food and medicines for up to 45,000 years as well as recently introduced fruits for commercial production. However, this range of fruits has not led to the development of functional foods, for example for chronic inflammatory diseases such as metabolic syndrome including obesity, hypertension, fatty liver and diabetes. This review examines the potential of tropical and subtropical fruits from Australia to be used as functional foods for metabolic syndrome, including Davidson's plum, Queen Garnet plum, durian, litchi, breadfruit, jackfruit, mangosteen, papaya, jabuticaba, coffee and seaweed. Preclinical studies have defined potential responses of these functional foods in metabolic syndrome but the usefulness in humans with metabolic syndrome requires clinical studies which are scarce in the relevant literature. Overall, these Australian examples show that tropical fruits can provide functional foods to decrease chronic inflammatory diseases.

AB Ephedrine, the main active ingredient of mahuang, may lead to weight loss; however, it can also induce cardiovascular side effects. As ephedrine use remains controversial, this study aimed to systematically review previous studies on ephedrine-containing products and perform meta-analysis of the existing evidence on weight, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and lipid change effects of ephedrine-containing products. We searched for placebo-controlled randomized studies in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE until July 2021 using the following search terms: (ephedr* OR mahuang) AND ( "weight loss " OR obes* OR overweight). Mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the effects of ephedrine-containing products on weight, BP, heart rate, and lipid profiles. A total of 10 articles were included. Compared with the placebo group, the ephedrine-containing product group was associated with greater weight loss, with an MD of -1.97 kg (95% CI: -2.38, -1.57). In the ephedrine-containing product group, the mean heart rate was 5.76 beats/min higher than in the placebo group (95% CI: 3.42, 8.10), whereas intergroup differences in systolic and diastolic BP were not statistically significant. The ephedrine-containing product group had a significantly higher mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (MD: 2.74 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.94, 4.55), lower mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (MD: -5.98 mg/dL; 95% CI: -10.97, -0.99), and lower mean triglyceride level (MD: -11.25 mg/dL; 95% CI: -21.83, -0.68) than the placebo group. Compared with placebo, the ephedrine-containing products showed better effects on weight loss and lipid profiles, whereas they caused increased heart rate. The ephedrine-containing products may be beneficial to obese or overweight patients; however, close monitoring is needed, especially heart rate monitoring.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with ethanolic and aqueous extracts from the bark of the stem of Guazuma ulmifolia in mice submitted to a high-fat diet as well as to evaluate the chemical composition of these extracts. The chemical composition and antioxidant potential was evaluated in aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark. The in vivo test consisted of evaluating the effects of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark on C57BL/6 mice receiving a high-fat diet. The animals were evaluated for weight gain, feed consumption, visceral adiposity, serum, and inflammatory and hormonal parameters. The results of the chemical analyses corroborate those obtained by the literature, which reported gallocatechin, epigallocatechin and epigallocatechin gallate. Compared with the ethanolic extract, the aqueous extract showed greater antioxidant capacity. Both extracts resulted in lower feed consumption in the animals, but they did not influence weight gain or visceral adiposity and resulted in varied changes in the lipid profile. In addition, they did not influence glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, or fasting blood glucose. Furthermore, the leptin levels increased, which may have contributed to satiety, but this was shown to have a negative impact on other inflammatory and hormonal parameters. Therefore, under the conditions of this study, the biologically active compounds present in the plant species Guazuma ulmifolia were not able to contribute to the treatment of metabolic changes related to the consumption of a high-fat diet.

AB Background: The study aimed to investigate the association between daily consumption of coffee or green tea, with and without habitual bread consumption for breakfast, and components and prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Japanese populations. Methods: The study population consisted of 3539 participants (1239 males and 2300 females). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression analyses to evaluate the associations of daily coffee and green tea consumption with the prevalence of obesity, visceral obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Results: Coffee consumption was associated with significantly lower proportions of visceral obesity (OR: 0.746, CI: 0.588-0.947) and metabolic syndrome (OR: 0.706, CI: 0.565-0.882). On the other hand, green tea was not associated with visceral obesity (OR: 1.105, CI: 0.885-1.380) or metabolic syndrome (OR: 0.980, CI: 0.796-1.206). The combination of daily drinking coffee and eating bread at breakfast time was associated with significantly lower proportions of obesity (OR: 0.613, CI: 0.500-0.751) (p = 0.911 for interaction), visceral obesity (OR: 0.549, CI: 0.425-0.710) (p = 0.991 for interaction), and metabolic syndrome (OR: 0.586, CI: 0.464-0.741) (p = 0.792 for interaction). Conclusion: Coffee consumption was significantly associated with lower visceral adipose tissue and lower proportions of visceral obesity, but the same was not true for green tea consumption. Furthermore, in combination with coffee consumption, the addition of eating bread at breakfast time significantly lowered proportions of visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome, although there was no interaction between coffee and bread.

AB Coffee is probably the most popular beverage after water and is an important component in diet and health since its consumption is high worldwide. Globally, it is the most relevant food commodity being just behind crude oil. Besides its pleasant flavor, it is an antioxidant source due to polyphenols, which are protective compounds against several diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the economic relevance and perform a systematic review of green coffee's effects on human health. Databases such as MEDLINE-PubMed, EMBASE, COCHRANE, and GOOGLE SCHOLAR were searched, and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Green coffee is considered a novel food product because consumers usually consume only roasted coffee. It can be marketed as such or as an extract. Due to the content of bioactive compounds, which are partially lost during the roasting process, the extracts are usually marketed concerning the potential regarding health effects. Green coffee can be used as dietary supplements, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, as a source of antioxidants. It can benefit human health, such as improvement in blood pressure, plasma lipids, and body weight (thus contributing to the improvement of risk components of Metabolic Syndrome). Moreover, benefits for cognitive functions may also be included.

AB Tea and citrus maxima are natural, medicinal homologous plants, typically used for making beverages, which have anticancer, antiobesity, and antioxidation properties. Green tea, yellow tea, and black tea were combined with citrus maxima to obtain green tea andCitrus maxima(GTCM), yellow tea andCitrus maxima(YTCM), and black tea andCitrus maxima(BTCM). The biochemical components of these mixtures were analyzed, and their possible effects and mechanisms on relieving liver lipid deposition were explored. The tea polyphenols, free amino acids, phenolamine ratio, and caffeine were comparable in YTCM and GTCM, being significantly higher than those in BTCM. In addition, the content of esterified catechins, nonesterified catechins, and total catechins in YTCM was significantly higher than those in GTCM and BTCM. All three mixtures ofCitrus maximatea significantly reduced lipid deposition in HepG2 cells, with GTCM and YTCM being slightly more effective than BTCM. Regarding the possible mechanism, Western blot analysis revealed that the threeCitrus maximatea mixtures could activate the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway, upregulate the expression of p-AMPK, p-ACC, and CPT-1 proteins, and downregulate the expression of SREBP1c and fatty acid synthase proteins to inhibit fat synthesis, thereby relieving lipid deposition in liver cells. In conclusion, as a novel and healthy beverage,Citrus maximatea has the potential to alleviate liver lipid deposition, and further could be responsible for obesity treatment.

AB IMPORTANCE Greater caffeine consumption in pregnancy is associated with reduced birth size, but potential associations with childhood growth are unclear.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the associations of pregnancy caffeine and paraxanthine measures with child growth in a contemporary cohort with low caffeine consumption and a historical cohort with high caffeine consumption.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes cohort of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies (ECHO-FGS; 10 sites, 2009-2013) was a pregnancy cohort with 1 child measurement between ages 4 and 8 years (follow-up in 2017-2019). The Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) was a pregnancy cohort (12 sites, 1959-1965) with child follow-up through 8 years (1960-1974). The current secondary analysis was conducted in 2021 and 2022. EXPOSURES Concentrations of caffeine and its primary metabolite, paraxanthine, were quantified from plasma (ECHO-FGS) and serum (CPP) collected in the first trimester. Cut points for analyses were defined by quartiles in ECHO-FGS and quintiles in CPP.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child z scores for body mass index, weight, and height were evaluated, as well as fat mass index and percentage and obesity risk measured at 1 time between age 4 and 8 years in ECHO-FGS. In a secondary analysis of the CPP cohort, child z scores and obesity risk longitudinally through age 8 years were evaluated.
   RESULTS In ECHO-FGS (median caffeine intake <50mg/d), 788 children (mean [SD] age, 6.8 [1.0] years; 411 boys [52.2%]) of women in the fourth vs first quartile of plasma caffeine concentrations had lower height z scores (beta = -0.21; 95% CI, -0.41 to -0.02), but differences in weight z scores were only observed in the third quartile (beta = -0.27; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.07). In CPP, beginning at age 4 years, 1622 children (805 boys [49.7%]) of women in the highest caffeine quintile group had lower height z scores than their peers from the lowest group, with the gap widening with each successive year of age (beta = -0.16 [95% CI, -0.31 to -0.01] at 4 years; beta = -0.37 [95% CI, -0.57 to -0.16] at 8 years). There were slight reductions in weight at ages 5 to 8 years for children in the third vs first caffeine quintile (beta = -0.16 to -0.22). Results were consistent for paraxanthine concentrations in both cohorts.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intrauterine exposure to increasing levels of caffeine and paraxanthine, even in low amounts, was associated with shorter stature in early childhood. The clinical implication of reductions in height and weight is unclear; however, the reductions were apparent even with levels of caffeine consumption below clinically recommended guidelines of less than 200mg per day.

AB Background The double burden of malnutrition (DBM) during adolescence is associated with growth and developmental impairment and risk of non-communicable diseases. There is limited evidence on adolescent's dietary patterns (DPs), and how they contribute to DBM in urban low income contexts in sub Saharan Africa. This study assessed DPs of adolescents, their drivers and association with DBM in Kenya's urban slums. Methods Anthropometric, socio-demographic and dietary-intake data were collected through a cross-sectional survey of 621 adolescents from three major urban slums in Nairobi, Kenya. DPs were derived using principal component analysis. Multinomial-logistic-regression was used to assess the association between the DPs, individual and environmental factors and DBM. Results Two DPs were identified: traditional DP (whole grains/cereals, rice, fruits, legumes/nuts, and water) and transitioning DP (refined cereals (maize/wheat), vegetables, meat, tea/coffee, sweet ultra-processed/deep fried snacks). Adolescents from Mathare (the largest slum) were more likely to adhere to the traditional DP (RRR = 3.43; 95% CI 1.85-6.37). Cultural background (Luo) had a positive association (RRR = 4.28; 95% CI 1.97-9.32), while longer residency in the slum (> 10 years) had a negative association (RRR = 0.47; 95% CI 0.25-0.90) with transitioning DP. The transitioning DP had a positive (non-linear) association with overweight/obesity in girls (RRR = 2.79; 95% CI 1.16-6.71). The DPs were not associated with thinness or stunting. Conclusion The DPs indicate various stages of nutrition transition of adolescent diets, which are influenced by cultural background, neighbourhood and duration of stay in the slum. Transitioning DP may expose adolescents to the risks of overweight/obesity in the long-term.

AB The suppression of pancreatic lipase has been employed to mitigate obesity. This study explored the mechanism of coffee leaf extracts to inhibit pancreatic lipase. The ethyl acetate fraction derived from coffee leaves (EAC) exhibited the highest inhibitory capacity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.469 mg/mL and an inhibitor constant (Ki) of 0.185 mg/mL. This fraction was enriched with 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5diCQA, 146.50 mg/g), epicatechin (87.51 mg/g), and isoquercetin (48.29 mg/g). EAC inhibited lipase in a reversible and competitive manner, and quenched its intrinsic fluorescence through a static mechanism. Molecular docking revealed that bioactive compounds in EAC bind to key amino acid residues (HIS-263, PHE-77, and SER-152) located within the active cavity of lipase. Catechin derivatives play a key role in the lipase inhibitory activity within EAC. Overall, our findings highlight the promising potential of coffee leaf extract as a functional ingredient for alleviating obesity through inhibition of lipase.

AB This study examined the associations between specific nonalcoholic beverages and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and their interactions with obesity. The study participants were 4,999 adults aged 19-64 years from the 2015-2016 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using multivariable logistic regression analyses. In women, there was an inverse linear trend between coffee and hs-CRP status (p(trend) = 0.0137), and a positive linear trend for soda was also found (>= 1/week vs never or almost never, OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.23-2.61, p(trend) = 0.0127). In the stratification analyses, the associations were only observed in obese women. The associations were inverse for coffee and tea but linearly positive for soda in obese women (p(trend)<0.05). In men, an inverted 1-shaped association between commercial fruit juice/drink and hs-CRP status was found; but after stratification by obesity, the association was linear only in obese men (p(trend)<0.05, OR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.44-4.16 in >= 1/week vs never or almost never). Coffee and tea in women may be beneficially associated with hs-CRP status, but soda in women and commercial fruit juice/drink in men may be adversely, particularly for obese adults.

AB Background: Obesity is a major health concern for breast cancer survivors, being associated with high recurrence and reduced efficacy during cancer treatment. Metformin treatment is associated with reduced breast cancer incidence, recurrence and mortality. To better understand the underlying mechanisms through which metformin may reduce recurrence, we aimed to conduct metabolic profiling of overweight/obese breast cancer survivors before and after metformin treatment. Methods: Fasting plasma samples from 373 overweight or obese breast cancer survivors randomly assigned to metformin (n = 194) or placebo (n = 179) administration were collected at baseline, after 6 months (Reach For Health trial), and after 12 months (MetBreCS trial). Archival samples were concurrently analyzed using three complementary methods: untargeted LC-QTOF-MS metabolomics, targeted LC-MS metabolomics (AbsoluteIDQ p180, Biocrates), and gas chromatography phospholipid fatty acid assay. Multivariable linear regression models and family-wise error correction were used to identify metabolites that significantly changed after metformin treatment. Results: Participants (n = 352) with both baseline and study end point samples available were included in the analysis. After adjusting for confounders such as study center, age, body mass index and false discovery rate, we found that metformin treatment was significantly associated with decreased levels of citrulline, arginine, tyrosine, caffeine, paraxanthine, and theophylline, and increased levels of leucine, isoleucine, proline, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate, alanine and indoxyl-sulphate. Long-chain unsaturated phosphatidylcholines (PC ae C36:4, PC ae C38:5, PC ae C36:5 and PC ae C38:6) were significantly decreased with the metformin treatment, as were phospholipid-derived long-chain n-6 fatty acids. The metabolomic profiles of metformin treatment suggest change in specific biochemical pathways known to impair cancer cell growth including activation of CYP1A2, alterations in fatty acid desaturase activity, and altered metabolism of specific amino acids, including impaired branched chain amino acid catabolism. Conclusions: Our results in overweight breast cancer survivors identify new metabolic effects of metformin treatment that may mechanistically contribute to reduced risk of recurrence in this population and reduced obesity-related cancer risk reported in observational studies.

AB Herbs have been of interest to treat diseases, including obesity, owing to their various bioactive constituents that exhibit therapeutic and prophylactic properties. The present study examined the anti-adipogenic effects and mechanisms of Chrysanthemum indicum aqueous extract (CAE) in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. CAE comprises 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, caffeic acid, and apigenin, which were corresponded with previous reports. CAE inhibited the accumulation of lipid droplets and significantly alleviated the expression of lipogenesis- and adipogenesis-associated biomarkers. Treatment with CAE inhibited the mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), corroborated by cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase, and mitigated the expression of cell cycle progression-associated proteins and in addition to phosphorylation of MCE-promoting transcription factors. Moreover, CAE downregulated the activation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways. In summary, CAE facilitates adipogenic inhibition during the early phase of differentiation, especially MCE, and its phenolic compounds can contribute to its anti-obesogenic properties. Practical applications Chrysanthemum indicum has been mainly used as traditional herbal tea and drinks. Chrysanthemum indicum aqueous extract (CAE) inhibits adipogenesis by suppressing mitotic clonal expansion during the early phase of differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. 1,3-Dicaffeoylquinic acid, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, caffeic acid, and apigenin were detected in CAE. Based on these findings, CAE can be used as nutraceutical agents for prevention and treatment of obesity.

AB Background The patterning of food intake at eating occasions is a poorly understood, albeit important, step towards achieving a healthy dietary pattern. However, to capture the many permutations of food combinations at eating occasions, novel analytic approaches are required. We applied a latent variable mixture modelling (LVMM) approach to understand how foods are consumed in relation to each other at breakfast. Methods Dietary intake at breakfast (n = 8145 occasions) was assessed via 24-h recall during the 2011-12 Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (n = 3545 men and n = 4127 women, > 19 y). LVMM was used to determine breakfast food profiles based on 35 food group variables, reflecting compliance with Australian Dietary Guidelines. F and adjusted-chi2 tests assessed differences in timing of consumption and participant characteristics between the breakfast profiles. Regression models, adjusted for covariates, were used to examine associations between breakfast food profiles and objective adiposity measures (BMI and waist circumference). Results Five distinct profiles were found. Three were similar for men and women. These were labelled: "Wholegrain cereals and milks" (men: 16%, women: 17%), "Protein-foods" (men and women: 11%) and "Mixed cereals and milks" (men: 33%, women: 37%). Two "Breads and spreads" profiles were also found that were differentiated by their accompanying beverages (men) or type of grain (women). Profiles were found to vary by timing of consumption, participant characteristics and adiposity indicators. For example, the "Protein-foods" profile occurred more frequently on weekends and after 9 am. Men with a "Bread and spreads (plus tea/coffee)" profile were older (P < 0.001) and had lower income and education levels (P < 0.05), when compared to the other profiles. Women with a "Protein-foods" profile were younger (P < 0.001) and less likely to be married (P < 0.01). Both men and women with a "Wholegrain cereals and milks" profile had the most favourable adiposity estimates (P < 0.05). Conclusions We identified five breakfast food profiles in adults that varied by timing of consumption, participant characteristics and adiposity indicators. LVMM was a useful approach for capturing the complexity of food combinations at breakfast. Future research could collect contextual information about eating occasions to understand the complex factors that influence food choices.

AB There are no medical drugs that provide an acceptable weight loss with minimal adverse effects. This study evaluated the Moringa peregrina (MP) seed extract's antiobesity effect. Twenty-four (6/each group) male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into group I (control), group II (high-fat diet [HFD]), group III (HFD+ MP [250mg/kg b.wt]), and group IV (HFD+ MP [500 mg/kg b.wt]). MP administration significantly ameliorated body weight gains and HFD induced elevation in cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and reduced HDL. Moreover, MP seed oil showed high free radical-scavenging activity, delayed beta-carotene bleaching and inhibited lipoprotein and pancreatic lipase enzymes. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed three major active components: crypto-chlorogenic acid, isoquercetin, and astragalin. Both quantitative Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and western blotting revealed that MP seeds oil significantly decreased the expression of lipogenesis-associated genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR gamma) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) and significantly elevated the expression of lipolysis-associated genes (acetylCoA carboxylasel, ACCI). The oil also enhanced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK-alpha) and suppressed CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBP beta). In conclusion, administration of M. peregrina seeds oil has anti-obesity potential in HFD-induced obesity in rats.
   Practical applications
   M. peregrina seeds oil had a potential anti-obesity activity that may be attributed to different mechanisms. These included decreasing body weight, and body mass index and improving lipid levels by decreasing total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-C, and increasing HDL-C. Also, M. peregrina seeds oil regulated adipogenesis-associated genes, such as downregulating the expression of (PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha, and FAS) and improving and upregulating the expression and phosphorylation of AMPK alpha and ACCI. Despite that M. peregrina extract has reported clear anti-obesity potential through animal and laboratory studies, the available evidence-based on human clinical trials are very limited. Therefore, further studies are needed that could focus on clinical trials investigating anti-obesity potential different mechanisms of M. peregrina extract in humans.

AB Viburnum opulusL. fruit is a rich source of phenolic compounds that may be involved in the prevention of metabolic diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects ofViburnum opulusfresh juice (FJ) and juice purified by solid-phase extraction (PJ) on the adipogenesis process with murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line and pancreatic lipase activity in triolein emulsion, as well as their phenolic profiles by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS. Decrease of lipids and triacylglycerol accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were in concordance with downregulation of the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP beta/alpha), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c). Furthermore, regulation of PPAR gamma-mediated beta-lactamase expression byV. opuluscomponents in reporter gene assay, as well as their binding affinity to ligand-binding domain of PPAR gamma, were tested. In addition, the levels of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, like fatty acid synthase (FAS) or acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), were decreased, along with inflammatory cytokines, like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-6 (Il-6) and leptin. Moreover, FJ and PJ were able to inhibit pancreatic lipase, which potentially could reduce the fat absorption from the intestinal lumen and the storage of body fat in the adipose tissues. Thirty-two phenolic compounds with chlorogenic acid as the dominant compound were identified in PJ which revealed significant biological activity. These data contribute to elucidateV. opulusjuice phenolic compounds' molecular mechanism in adipogenesis regulation in 3T3-L1 cells and dietary fat lipolysis.

AB Background Snacking is associated with a higher daily energy intake and dietary guidelines recommend snacks of no more than 200 kcal for adults and 100 kcal for children. The present study examines the energy content, nutritional quality and price of single-serving snack food products sold by major supermarket and coffee shop chains in the UK.
   Methods Energy content, nutritional content and price of single-serving snack products were recorded in 2019 via the websites of 14 major chains (seven supermarkets; seven coffee shops).
   Results The mean energy content of all eligible snack products (n = 2283) was 186 kcal [95% confidence interval (CI) = 182-190]. The mean energy content of the snack products sold at coffee shops (n = 379; 282 kcal [95% CI = 269-295]) was significantly higher than the energy content of the snack products sold at supermarkets (n = 1904; 167 kcal [95% CI = 164-170]). Seventy nine % of supermarket snacks exceeded energy recommendations for children and 32% for adults. In coffee shops, 91% exceeded recommendations for children and 73% for adults. Forty one % of snacks were high in fat, 42% were high in saturated fat, 39% were high in sugar and 7% were high in salt. Cheaper snack products were more likely to be of lower nutritional quality.
   Conclusions The high proportion of snack products that do not meet public health recommendations for energy content may contribute to the association between snacking and increased energy intake. Public health measures to increase the availability and reduce the price of snack products that meet public health energy content recommendations may reduce population-level obesity.

AB The Beverage Guidance System has established dietary recommendations for daily intake of commonly consumed beverages including water, tea, coffee, milk, non-calorically sweetened beverages, and calorically sweetened beverages. As obesity in America continues to be a growing problem, this guidance becomes of increasing importance due to many beverages' potential links to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), Cardiovascular disease (CVD), and numerous other harmful health effects. However, the growing popularity of "better for you" beverages is causing a shift in the market, with consumers pushing for healthier beverage alternatives. Beverages simultaneously present advantages while posing concerns that need to be evaluated and considered. In this review, health effects of nonalcoholic beverages are discussed including various aspects of consumption and current trends of the beverage market such as the novel Soft Seltzer category as an alternative to Hard Seltzer and various mashups. A variety of advisory boards and agencies responsible for dietary guidelines in various countries suggest drinking water as the preferred practice for hydration.

AB Objective: The aim of the study was to identify dietary patterns associated with overweight and obesity and to examine the effect of including and excluding misreporters on the analysis of these dietary patterns and on the associations between identified dietary patterns and anthropometric parameters.
   Methods: The study was carried out with adult participants in an observational case-control manner. The participants' diet was assessed using 3-d dietary records. To identify misreporters, the Goldberg and Black cutoff method was used. Dietary patterns were evaluated using factor analysis and dietary indices.
   Results: Among 410 participants, 100 were underreporters and 1 was an overreporter. The nutritional value of the diets and the relative intake of several groups of food products differed between those with normal and increased body weight. Excluding misreporters affected the differences between body weight groups in energy; dietary fiber; empty calories; cholesterol; sodium; magnesium; folate; vitamins C, PP, and A; groats; vegetables; coffee; and water intake. The Western diet (WD) factor correlated positively with the waist circumference and the amount of fat tissue, whereas the healthy diet (HD) factor correlated negatively with body weight, waist circumference, and the fat tissue amount. The coefficients of the correlation between the HD factor and the anthropometric parameters were stronger when misreporters were excluded, whereas those between the WD factor and the parameters did not change much after exclusion of misreporters.
   Conclusions: There is a positive relationship between the WD pattern and obesity. The exclusion of misreporters from the data set may positively affect the association between the HD pattern and anthropometric parameters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Obesity is characterised by an excessive build-up of lipids and triglycerides in adipocytes. Phenolic acids and flavonoids have previously been shown to inhibit body weight increase and fat buildup in mice. This study investigated the anti-obesity effect of phenolics, syringic (SYA) and sinapic acid (SIA) and flavonoids hesperidin (HD) and chrysin (CR) along with caffeine (CAF) on 3T3-L1 cells. Anti-obesity on 3T3-L1 adipocytes was evaluated by MTT assay, ORO staining, TG quantification and NBT assay. 100 mu mol CAF exhibited adipogenesis, lipogenesis and ROS accumulation which was reduced with combinations of SYA, SIA, HD and CR in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, CAF + SYA/SIA/HD/CR inhibited the mRNA expression of PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha and SREBP-1c in mature adipocytes. Taken together, these preliminary data demonstrate that these phytocompounds prevent CAF-induced adipogenesis. These phytocompounds can be exploited further to study the in vitro and in vivo anti-adipogenic mechanism in combination with caffeine.

AB Background: Coffee consumption is inversely associated with type 2 diabetes. Cafestol, a bioactive compound in coffee, has demonstrated glucose-lowering and insulin-secretory properties in cell and animal studies. The acute effects of cafestol on glucose metabolism in humans have only been briefly investigated, and longer-term effects have not been explored. This study aimed to assess the effects of purified cafestol on insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters in healthy individuals with increased waist circumference at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Methods: A 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial was conducted with 40 participants. Insulin suppression tests, mixed meal tests, and MRI scans were performed before and after the intervention. Results: Administering 6 mg of cafestol twice daily did not alter insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance but led to significant reductions in body weight (2%), visceral fat volume (5%), and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (15%) compared to the placebo. Conclusions: Cafestol may hold promise for weight and visceral fat reduction. Cafestol did not improve insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance in this study but might still contribute to the observed inverse association between coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes. Future research should explore higher dosages and longer treatment durations, particularly in individuals with impaired glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes.

AB Plants have been known since ancient times for their healing properties, being used as preparations against human diseases of different etiologies. More recently, natural products have been studied and characterized, isolating the phytochemicals responsible for their bioactivity. Most certainly, there are currently numerous active compounds extracted from plants and used as drugs, dietary supplements, or sources of bioactive molecules that are useful in modern drug discovery. Furthermore, phytotherapeutics can modulate the clinical effects of co-administered conventional drugs. In the last few decades, the interest has increased even more in studying the positive synergistic effects between plant-derived bioactives and conventional drugs. Indeed, synergism is a process where multiple compounds act together to exert a merged effect that is greater than that of each of them summed together. The synergistic effects between phytotherapeutics and conventional drugs have been described in different therapeutic areas, and many drugs are based on synergistic interactions with plant derivatives. Among them, caffeine has shown positive synergistic effects with different conventional drugs. Indeed, in addition to their multiple pharmacological activities, a growing body of evidence highlights the synergistic effects of caffeine with different conventional drugs in various therapeutic fields. This review aims to provide an overview of the synergistic therapeutic effects of caffeine and conventional drugs, summarizing the progress reported to date.

AB Background and objective: LN19183 is a proprietary, synergistic combination of Citrus aurantifolia fruit rind and Theobroma cacao seed extracts that increased resting energy expenditure (REE) in high-fat diet (HFD)fed obese rats. The objective of this study was to validate the thermogenic potential of LN19183 in obese Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and to assess its clinical efficacy in a proof-of-concept, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over human trial. Methods: : In the rat study, HFD-fed obese rats were supplemented with either HFD alone or with 45, 90, or 180 mg LN19183 per kg body weight (BW) for 28 days. In the human study, 60 overweight adults (male and female, aged 20-39 years) were randomized. Subjects took LN19183 (450 mg) or a matched placebo capsule on two consecutive days in phases one and two of the study, separated by a 10-day washout period. In each phase, on day 1, REE at pre-dose, 60-, 120-, and 180-min post-dose, and on day 2, metabolic rates at pre-dose and post-dose during and 20 min after exercise were measured using indirect calorimetry. Results: In rats, LN19183 significantly increased REE, reduced BW gain and fat masses, and increased fat and carbohydrate metabolism marker proteins including beta 3 adrenergic receptor (beta 3-AR), phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in the liver, and serum adiponectin levels. Furthermore, LN19183-supplemented human volunteers increased (P P < 0.05, vs. placebo) the metabolic rates at rest and with exercise; their fat oxidation was increased (P P < 0.05, vs. placebo) at rest and 20 min post-exercise. The groups' systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rates (HR), and safety parameters were comparable. Conclusion:These observations suggest that LN19183 is a thermogenic botanical composition with no stimulatory effects on BP and HR.

AB Spent coffee grounds (SCG; MR-medium and DR-dark-roasted) were submitted to an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion followed by a colonic fermentation using two microbiota communities (lean and overweight). The in vitro protective colonic effect of SCG was evaluated on colonic enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, tryptophanase, and urease). The bioaccessibility of oligosaccharides and melanoidins, as well as colonic short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and ester production were determined and correlated with evaluated colonic enzymes. Melanoidins (8-17 mg/100 g) were highly correlated with antioxidant capacity (16-80 mu mol Trolox/g sample; r=-0.78, p=0.0001, ABTS), while raffinose was only detected during the colonic phase (1.22-4.23 mg/g) suggesting SCG use as human microbiota substrate. The extract obtained from MR-SCG colonic fermentation inhibited enzyme activity (up to 80%) at a rate similar to or even higher than inulin (used as a positive control during colonic fermentation). Using the same substrate (MR-SCG), microbial communities produced different amounts and SCFAs ester patterns, linked to the enzymatic inhibition effects. OW-microbiota produced the highest cumulative SCFAs (36 nmol/L; 55% more than L-microbiota). Molecular studies, and in vivo assays are needed to further elucidate the mechanisms exerted by SCG. Microbial communities need to be identified to determine the colonic effects of SCG and support their use as a functional food ingredient.
   Industrial relevance: Our results support the added value of this industrial by-product to be used as a nutraceutical or functional ingredient for food products. Reducing food losses and waste 'is essential' to improve the sustainability of food systems, and contribute to broader systemic changes, including nutrition and health. SCG are digested under in vitro human gastrointestinal condition, where nutraceutical compounds are released from the matrix exerting health benefits, including antioxidant capacity, and positively modulating indicators of colonic microbial activity.

AB Recent evidence shows that COVID-19 patients with existing metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome, are exposed to a high risk of morbidity and mortality. At the same time, in order to manage the pandemic, the health authorities around the world are advising people to stay at home. This results in decreased physical activity and an increased consumption of an unhealthy diet, which often leads to an increase in body weight, risk for diabetes, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, and thus, paradoxically, to a high risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 complications. Here we summarize the evidence demonstrating that the promotion of a healthy life style, including physical activity and a dietary intake of natural polyphenols present in coffee and tea, has the potential to improve the prevention and management of insulin resistance and diabetes in the time of COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, it would be pertinent to evaluate further the potential positive effects of coffee beverages, rich in natural polyphenols, as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19, which appear not to be studied sufficiently.

AB Although coffee consumption has been historically associated with negative health outcomes, recent evidence suggests a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes among regular coffee drinkers. Among the plethora of minor organic compounds assessed as potential mediators of coffee health benefits, trigonelline and its pyrolysis product N-methylpyridinium (NMP) were preliminary shown to promote glucose uptake and exert anti-adipogenic properties. Against this background, we aimed at characterizing the effects of trigonelline and NMP in inflamed and dysfunctional human adipocytes. Human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes were treated with NMP or, for comparison, trigonelline, for 5 h before stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. NMP at concentrations as low as 1 mu mol/L reduced the stimulated expression of several pro-inflammatory mediators, including C-C Motif chemokine ligand (CCL)-2, C-X-C Motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-10, and intercellular adhesion Molecule (ICAM)-1, but left the induction of prostaglandin G/H synthase (PTGS)2, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and colony stimulating factor (CSF)1 unaffected. Furthermore, NMP restored the downregulated expression of adiponectin (ADIPOQ). These effects were functionally associated with downregulation of the adhesion of monocytes to inflamed adipocytes. Under the same conditions, NMP also reversed the TNF-alpha-mediated suppression of insulin-stimulated Ser473 Akt phosphorylation and attenuated the induction of TNF-alpha-stimulated lipolysis restoring cell fat content. In an attempt to preliminarily explore the underlying mechanisms of its action, we show that NMP restores the expression of the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma and downregulates activation of the pro-inflammatory mitogen-activated protein jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In conclusion, NMP reduces adipose dysfunction in pro-inflammatory activated adipocytes. These data suggest that bioactive NMP in coffee may improve the inflammatory and dysmetabolic milieu associated with obesity.

AB Objective To evaluate the consumption of free sugars and associated factors in the diet of university students entering full-time courses at a public university in Mato Grosso.Methods Cross-sectional study with students aged 16 to 26 years in the first semester of 2016, 2017, and 2018. Average sugar consumption was estimated using a 24-hour diet recall, evaluating the percentage of free sugars in total energy intake and the prevalence of consumption greater than 10.0% of total energy intake, according to socioeconomic and lifestyle variables, stratified by sex, and the foods that most contributed to its consumption.Results A total of 1,063 students were evaluated, the percentage of free sugars in the students' diet was on average 14.3% among men and 15.4% among women, with the prevalence of consumption above 10.0% also being higher among women (72.6 vs. 66.6%). There was a direct relationship between the participation of free sugars in the highest tertiles of energy intake, and the main food groups sources of sugar were desserts, juices, soft drinks, and coffee. There was a significant association between courses outside the health sciences, tobacco use, and unsatisfactory meal consumption profile with higher consumption of free sugars among women. Among men, sugar consumption was higher among those who were not overweight compared to those who were overweight.Conclusion The consumption of free sugars is high among university students, being associated with higher energy consumption, especially for sweetened beverages.

AB Using a combination of respiratory gas exchange, infrared thermography, and blood glucose (BGL) analysis, we have investigated the impact of Capsicum annuum (C. annuum) fruit powder (475 mg) or caffeine (100 mg) on metabolic activity in a placebo controlled (lactose, 100 mg) double-blinded three-way cross-over-design experiment. Metabolic measurements were made on day 1 and day 7 of supplementation in eight adult male participants (22.2 +/- 2 years of age, BMI 23 +/- 2 kg/m(2), x(-) +/- SD). Participants arrived fasted overnight and were fed a high carbohydrate meal (90 g glucose), raising BGL from fasting baseline (4.4 +/- 0.3 mmol/L) to peak BGL (8.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/L) 45 min after the meal. Participants consumed the supplement 45 min after the meal, and both caffeine and C. annuum fruit powder restored BGL (F-(8,F-178) = 2.2, p = 0.02) to near fasting levels within 15 min of supplementation compared to placebo (120 min). In parallel both supplements increased energy expenditure (F-(2,F-21) = 175.6, p < 0.001) over the 120-min test period (caffeine = 50.74 +/- 2 kcal/kg/min, C. annuum fruit = 50.95 +/- 1 kcal/kg/min, placebo = 29.34 +/- 1 kcal/kg/min). Both caffeine and C. annuum fruit powder increased supraclavicular fossa temperature (F-(2,F-42) = 32, p < 0.001) on both day 1 and day 7 of testing over the 120-min test period. No statistical difference in core temperature or reference point temperature, mean arterial pressure or heart rate was observed due to supplementation nor was any statistical difference seen between day 1 and day 7 of intervention. This is important for implementing dietary ingredients as potential metabolism increasing supplements. Together the results imply that through dietary supplements such as caffeine and C. annuum, mechanisms for increasing metabolism can be potentially targeted to improve metabolic homeostasis in people.

AB effects and the mechanism involved. COME reduced body weight, fat mass, adipose tissue weight, and serum levels of insulin, triglyceride, and leptin, but increased the serum levels of adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57BL/6 mice. COME increased AMPK activation. COME suppressed adipogenesis by decreasing CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma,sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, ATP-citrate lyase, fatty acid synthase, and adipocyte protein 2 mRNA expression and enhanced lipolysis by increasing carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 and hormone sensitive lipase mRNA expression. These results suggest that COME is potentially beneficial in inhibiting HFD-induced obesity by inducing AMPK activation and thereby, regulating several pathways involved in inhibiting adipogenesis, and promoting lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Our results suggest that COM may be used as an anti-obesity agent.

AB The effects of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) berry pulp extracts (CBP extracts) on the improvement of diabetes, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were evaluated using various in vitro antioxidant activity assays and through a high-fat diet-induced mild diabetic obese mouse model. After an 84-day oral administration of CBP extracts (400-100 mg/kg), bioactivities were evaluated. The in vitro analysis showed the highest DPPH center dot scavenging activity of 73.10 +/- 4.27%, ABTS(center dot) scavenging activity of 41.18 +/- 1.14%, and SOD activity of 56.24 +/- 2.81%, at a CBP extract concentration of 1000 mu g/mL. The in vivo analysis of the CBP extracts showed favorable and dose-dependent anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, NAFLD, nephropathy, and hyperlipidemia refinement effects through hepatic glucose enzyme activity, 5 '-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) up-regulation, antioxidant activity, lipid metabolism-related gene expression, and pancreatic lipid digestion enzyme modulatory activities. This study shows that an appropriate oral dosage of CBP extracts could function as a potent herbal formulation for a refinement agent or medicinal food ingredient to control type 2 diabetes and related complications.

AB Changes in consumption of sugar sweetened beverage (SSBs) have been associated with increased body mass index (BMI), but little work has evaluated the effect on waist circumference (WC) and body fat percentage during adolescence, a period characterized by rapid growth and change in dietary behaviors. We examined the relationship of changes in SSB intake and changes in adiposity over two years in 464 Mexican adolescents. Food frequency questionnaires were used to sum intake of regular soda, coffee with sugar, tea with sugar, sweetened water with fruit, chocolate milk, corn atole, and a sweetened probiotic milk beverage. Linear regression models were used to estimate the associations of changes in SSBs with changes in BMI, body fat percentage, and WC, adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, screen time, physical activity, age, and change in age. Adolescents who increased their daily SSB intake by >2 serving had a -2.72% higher body fat percentage (95% CI: 0.61, 4.82); a 1-2 serving increase was associated with a 2.49 cm increase (95% CI: 0.21, 4.76) in WC compared with those with no change in intake. Within an adolescent sample, changes in SSB intake were related to concomitant changes in body fat percentage and WC, but not BMI.

   INDEX
AB Background: Childhood obesity is a national public health issue with increasing prevalence. It has been linked to diet, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility, with more recent evidence that it could also result from environmental factors. Studies linking it to environmental factors are limited, unsystematic, incomprehensive, and inconclusive.
   Objective: To conduct an environment-wide association study (EWAS) to comprehensively investigate all the environmental factors available in a nationally representative sample of children to determine factors associated with childhood obesity.
   Methods: We utilized the 1999-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) datasets and included all children/adolescents (6-17 years). Obesity was measured using body mass index and waist to height ratio. A multinomial and binary logistic regression were used adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, creatinine, calorie intake, physical activity, screen time, limitation to physical activities, and socioeconomic status. We then controlled for multiple hypothesis testing and validated our findings on a different cohort of children.
   Results: We found that metals such as beryllium (OR: 3.305 CI: 1.460-7.479) and platinum (OR: 1.346 CI: 1.107-1.636); vitamins such as gamma-tocopherol (OR: 8.297 CI: 5.683-12.114) and delta-tocopherol (OR: 1.841 CI:1.476-2.297); heterocyclic aromatic amines such as 2-Amino-9H-pyrido (2,3-b) indole (OR: 1.323 CI: 1.083-1.617) and 2-Amino-3-methyl-9H-pyriodo(2,3-b)indole (OR: 2.799 CI: 1.442-5.433); polycyclic aromatic amines such as 9 - fluorene (OR: 1.509 CI: 1.230-1.851) and 4-phenanthrene (OR: 2.828 CI: 1.632-4.899); and caffeine metabolites such as 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid (OR: 1.22 CI: 1.029-1.414) and 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine (OR: 1.258 CI: 1.075-1.473) were positively and significantly associated with childhood obesity.
   Conclusion: Following the unique concept of EWAS, certain environmental factors were associated with childhood obesity. Further studies are required to confirm these associations while investigating their mechanisms of action.

AB Diabetes is currently a worldwide health concern. Hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, and oxidative stress are the major risk factors that inevitably lead to all the complications from diabetes. These complications severely impact the quality of life of patients, and they can be managed, reduced, or even reverted by several polyphenols, plant extracts and foods rich in these compounds. The goal of this review is to approach diabetes not as a single condition but rather an interconnected combination of risk factors and complications. This work shows that polyphenols have multi target action and effects and they have been systematically proven to be relevant in the reduction of each risk factor and improvement of associated complication.

AB Background: Central obesity is defined as the excessive fat tissue located in abdominal region accompanied by systemic inflammation, which drives to cardiovascular disease. Flavonols are antioxidative agents present in food. The aim of this study was investigating the relationship between dietary flavonols intake and central obesity. Methods and results: 80 participants (40 central obese and 40 healthy controls) were administered a food frequency questionnaire dedicated to flavonols intake assessment. Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis. The analysis showed significant differences between central obese participants and healthy controls in total flavonol (p = 0.005), quercetin (p = 0.003), kaempferol (p = 0.04) and isorhamnetin (p < 0.001) habitual intake. Among central obese participants, there was a moderate inverse correlation between fat mass (FM) and total flavonol (R = -0.378; 95% CI: -0.620 to -0.071; p = 0.02), quercetin (R = -0.352; 95% CI: -0.601 to -0.041; p = 0.03), kaempferol (R = -0.425; 95% CI: -0.653 to -0.127; p = 0.01) and myricetin intake (R = -0.352; 95% CI: -0.601 to -0.041; p = 0.03). BMI was inversely correlated with total flavonol (R = -0.330; 95% CI: -0.584 to -0.016; p = 0.04) and quercetin intake (R = -0.336; 95% CI: -0.589 to -0.023; p = 0.04). Waist circumference was inversely correlated with total flavonol (R = -0.328; 95% CI: -0.586 to -0.009; p = 0.04), quercetin (R = -0.322; 95% CI: -0.582 to -0.002; p = 0.048) and myricetin intake (R = -0.367; 95% CI: -0.615 to -0.054; p = 0.02). Among flavonols' dietary sources, there was an inverse correlation between black tea consumption and FM (R: -0.511; 95% CI: -0.712 to -0.233; p < 0.001) and between coffee and waist circumference (R: -0.352; 95% CI: -0.604 to -0.036; p = 0.03) in central obese participants. Conclusions: The higher flavonol intake could play a protective role in abdominal obesity development. What is more, total and selected flavonol dietary intakes are inversely correlated with the parameters used for obesity assessment in central obese participants. The habitual consumption of products rich in flavonols, mainly tea and coffee, could possibly have a preventive role in abdominal obesity development.

AB Melanoidins are Maillard reaction products similar to dietary fiber but their effect on food intake was under-investigated. A randomized, crossover study of 14 healthy subjects investigated whether melanoidins modulated energy intake and affected the postprandial dynamics of 21 gut-brain modulators of appetite including gastrointestinal peptides, endocannabinoids, N-acylethanolamines and neuropeptides. At breakfast the subjects consumed a bread enriched with either 3 g coffee melanoidins (CM), 3 g bread melanoidins (BM), or a conventional bread (CT). Energy intakes at lunch and throughout the day were measured, while appetite sensations and blood samples were collected before and 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after breakfast. Compared to CT, CM significantly reduced daily energy intake by 26%. CM lowered blood glucose peak, insulin, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, orexin-A, beta-endorphin, and blunted the response of three N-acylethanolamines versus BM. Coffee melanoidins at breakfast reduces daily energy intake and modulates postprandial glycemia and other biomarkers.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate polyphenol intake in women with different classes of obesity and identify which are consumed more frequently and what the food sources are.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 114 women with obesity. The study evaluated polyphenol intake via a 3-d food record using Phenol-Explorer. Anthropometric, biochemical, and dietetic variables were evaluated.
   Results: The women's habitual food intake was low calorie and adequate in macronutrients. Mean polyphenol intake by the group was 573 +/- 490, 614 +/- 475, and 379 +/- 25 mg/d for class I, class II, and class III obesity (P = 0.002), respectively. The most frequent food or beverage consumed by the group was coffee and caffeoylquinic acid, its phenolic compound. Fruits, vegetables, and nuts contributed the least to the intake of polyphenols.
   Conclusions: Although the diets of the study participants did include some food sources of polyphenols, they were not of sufficient quality to significantly contribute to a healthy diet; instead, they sometimes were foods may have that contributed to weight gain. Women with class III obesity consumed the most calories; however, they had low fruit, vegetable, and whole foods intake. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Energy Drinks (EDs) and Soft Drinks (SDs) are widely consumed among adolescents and young adults. These drinks contain variable amounts of caffeine which is a central nervous system stimulator; in addition to sugar, taurine, vitamins and herbal extracts. Several adverse effects have been reported for the excessive consumption of caffeine and sugar. Aim: This work aimed at providing a comparison between the effect of chronic consumption of both drinks on metabolism biochemically as well as at the histopathological level. Methods: Adult albino rats were randomly divided into three groups and treated for 4 weeks. Animals received water (control, group 1), 12.5 ml/kg/day of either Pepsi degrees (SD, group 2) or Power Horse' (ED, group 3). All animals had free access to water and standard animal chow. Results: ED and SD groups showed a significant weight gain compared to control. ED animals showed a significant increase in serum urea, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in comparison to control and SD groups. Serum uric acid significantly increased in ED and SD groups. ED group showed congestion and inflammation in their renal tissues in addition to splenomegaly and increased phagocyte infiltration. Conclusion: The high caffeine-sugar content in ED exerts a more significant influence on the metabolic pathways than SDs. Both increase the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and tissue inflammation due to their effect on lipid profile and blood glucose. The other ingredients in EDs may play a role in the observed metabolic disturbances. Chronic use of EDs should be especially discouraged to avoid these negative effects.

ID BEAN EXTRACT
AB Objectives: The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of green coffee bioactives in ameliorating the effects of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity through in vitro and in vivo assessments.
   Methods: Green coffee extract (GCE) was obtained by implementing a novel green extraction technique. The efficacy of GCE to inhibit in vitro pancreatic amylase and lipase was evaluated. Further, in vivo studies were conducted using a C57BL6 mice model grouped as starch-fed diet control, HFD control, HFD + positive control, HFD + GCE (100 mg/kg body weight), and HFD + GCE (200 mg/kg body weight). Animal body weight, diet intake, and fecal fat excretion were measured during the feeding period. On completion of the experiment, blood serum was collected for biochemical analysis, and organs were harvested for assessing the obesity-related biomarkers.
   Results: The obtained GCE was enriched with polyphenols and alkaloids. GCE led to significant (P < 0.05) in vitro inhibition of pancreatic amylase and lipase. GCE supplementation considerably prevented weight gain in treated groups post-consumption of HFD. It also led to increased fecal fat excretion and regulated the high-fat-mediated blood glucose levels. GCE effectively modulated the blood lipid profile, morphology of adipose and liver tissues, and liver antioxidant defense enzymes and resulted in hepatoprotective effects. It also downregulated the genes associated with lipid biosynthesis.
   Conclusions: GCE exhibits promising results in suppressing the consequences associated with HFD-induced obesity. It has the potential to be incorporated into food products benefiting consumer health and food industries. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background Thermogenic supplements are widely used in the general population to support attempted fat loss; however, the efficacy and safety of these supplements are questioned. Purpose To determine whether a thermogenic supplement affects metabolic rate, hemodynamic responses, and mood states. Methods In a randomized double-blind crossover design, 23 females (22.2 +/- 3.5 years; 164.8 +/- 6.4 cm; 73.5 +/- 6.9 kg) who were moderate caffeine consumers (<150 mg/day) reported to the lab after a 12 h fast for baseline assessments of resting energy expenditure (REE) via indirect calorimetry, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (SBP and DBP), blood variables, and hunger, satiety, and mood states. Thereafter, subjects ingested the assigned treatment (active treatment containing caffeine, micronutrients, and phytochemicals [TR] or placebo [PL]). All variables were reassessed at 30-, 60-, 120-, and 180 min post-ingestion. Subjects repeated the same protocol with ingestion of the opposite treatment on a separate day. All data were analyzed using a 2 x 5 ANOVA with repeated measures and significance was accepted a priori at p Results In the TR group, mean increases in REE of 121 to 166 kcal/d were observed at 30-, 60-, and 180 min post-ingestion (p < 0.01 for all). PL group mean decreases in REE of 72 to 91 kcal/day were observed at 60-, 120-, and 180 min (p < 0.05 for all). Respiratory quotient decreased at 120 and 180 min in both treatments. Slight increases in SBP of 3-4 mmHg were observed at 30, 120, and 180 min (p < 0.05 for all) post-ingestion of TR, while no effects were observed for DBP. Observed increases in SBP were within normal blood pressure ranges. TR decreased subjective fatigue with no other significant changes in mood states. Glycerol was maintained in TR, while there was a decrease at 30, 60, and 180 min (p < 0.05 for all) post-ingestion of PLA. Free fatty acids increased in TR at 60 and 180 min (p < 0.05) post-ingestion as well as a significant difference between treatments at 30 min post-ingestion indicating greater circulating free fatty acids levels in TR vs. PL (p < 0.01). Conclusion These findings indicate that ingestion of a specific thermogenic supplement formulation produces a sustained increase in metabolic rate and caloric expenditure and reduces fatigue over 3 h without producing adverse hemodynamic responses.

AB This study aimed to describe street food purchases in cities from Central Asia, considering customers' characteristics and the nutritional composition of the foods and beverages. Cross-sectional studies were conducted in 2016/2017 in Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), Ashgabat (Turkmenistan) and Almaty (Kazakhstan). Direct observation was used to collect data on the purchases made by street food customers, selected by random and systematic sampling. Nutritional composition was estimated using data from chemical analyses, food composition tables or food labels. A total of 714 customers (56.6% females, 55.5% aged degrees 5 years, 23.3% overweight/obese) were observed, who bought 852 foods and beverages, the most frequent being savoury pastries/snacks (23.2%), main dishes (19.0%), sweet pastries/confectionery (17.9%), tea/coffee (11.3%) and soft drinks/juices (9.8%). Fruit was the least purchased food (1.1%). Nearly one-third of customers purchased industrial food items (31.9%). The median energy content of a street food purchase was 529 kcal/serving. Saturated and trans-fat median contents were 4.7 g/serving and 0.36 g/serving (21.4% and 16.5% of maximum daily intake recommendations, respectively). Median sodium and potassium contents were 745 mg/serving (37.3% of maximum recommendation) and 304 mg/serving (8.7% of minimum recommendation), respectively. In general, the purchases observed presented high contents of energy, saturated-fat, trans-fat and sodium, and low levels of potassium. Policies towards the improvement of these urban food environments should be encouraged.

TI Association of unsweetened and sweetened tea consumption with the risk
   of new-onset chronic kidney disease: Findings from UK Biobank and
   Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH

AB Background The association between tea consumption and chronic kidney disease (CKD) remained inconsistent. We aimed to evaluate the association of tea consumption with new-onset CKD and examine the effects of com-mon additives (milk and sweeteners) and genetic variations in caffeine me-tabolism on the association.Methods 176 038 and 3104 participants free of CKD at baseline in the Unit-ed Kingdom Biobank (UK Biobank) and Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study were included, respectively. Dietary in-formation was collected using 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires. The study outcome was new-onset CKD.Results In the UK Biobank, during a median follow-up of 12.13 years, 3535 (2.01%) participants developed CKD. Compared with tea non-consumers, the risk of new-onset CKD was significantly lower in unsweetened tea con-sumers (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.76-0.93), but not in sweetened tea consumers (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.85-1.08), regard-less of whether milk was added to tea. Accordingly, relative to tea non-con-sumers, the adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of new-onset CKD for participants who reported drinking unsweetened tea 1.5 or fewer, >1.5 to 2.5, >2.5 to 3.5, >3.5 to 4.5, and >4.5 drinks/d were HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.75-0.99; HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78-1.00; HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.73-0.94; HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.72-0.95; and HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.75-0.99. Moreover, the as-sociation of unsweetened tea consumption with new-onset CKD was stron-ger among those with faster genetically predicted caffeine metabolism lev-els, although the interaction was insignificant (P-value interaction = 0.768). Consistently, in the CARDIA study, compared with tea non-consumers, a significantly lower risk of new-onset CKD was found in unsweetened tea consumers (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65-0.98) but not in sweetened tea con-sumers (HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.70-1.34).Conclusions Compared with tea non-consumers, consumption of unsweet-ened tea, but not sweetened tea, was significantly associated with a lower risk of new-onset CKD, regardless of whether milk was added.

AB Dali tea (DLT) made by wild tea plant (Camellia taliensis) has been very popular in the market.However, the signature compounds and health benefits of DLT were not reported yet. To comprehensively understand metabolite signatures and potential health-function, the distinct metabolite signatures and hypoadiposity effect between DLT and Yunkang tea (YKT, made by Camellia sinensis var assamica cv. Yunkang 10) were comparative investigated. Our data found that catechins, and dimeric catechins were lower in DLT than YKT. In contrast, the levels of phenolic acid and amino acids were higher in DLT than YKT. An un-targeted metabolomics and a chemometric analysis indicated that flavonoid biosynthesis is a major pathway that distinguishes DLT from YKT. Additionally, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, arginine, tyrosine, and theanine were identified as characteristic metabolites of DLT. Furthermore, animal experiment showed that YKT performs better efficiency than DLT on alleviating hyperadiposity and renal damages in high-fat-diet induced obese mice.

AB Tropical foods are an integral part of the traditional diet and form part of traditional medicine in many countries. This review examines the potential of tropical foods to treat signs of metabolic syndrome, defined as a chronic low-grade inflammation leading to obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and fatty liver. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease as well as osteoarthritis and some cancers. Tropical foods such as seaweeds and tropical fruits including indigenous fruits such as Davidson's plums are effective in reducing these signs of metabolic syndrome in rats, as well as reducing degeneration of bone cartilage and altering gut microbiome. Further, waste products from tropical fruits including mangosteen rind, coffee pulp and spent coffee grounds provide further options to reduce metabolic syndrome. Production of local tropical foods and local recovery of food waste from these foods could allow the development of commercial, sustainable and cost-effective functional foods in tropical countries. The aim is to develop these functional foods to reduce the incidence of metabolic syndrome and decrease the risk of costly chronic cardiovascular and metabolic disorders locally and globally.

AB Prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) has been positively associated with elevated body mass index (BMI) in children. Why this association occurs is unclear, but it is possible that PCE alters the in utero development of brain structures associated with food preference, leading to more total sugar intake (TSI, grams) later in childhood. To test this hypothesis, we investigated if PCE (daily/weekly/<weekly vs. no exposure) and elevated BMI are associated with increased TSI, neural activation during large reward anticipation (monetary incentive delay task-functional MRI) and structural changes (thickness, mm) in taste processing regions of children (n = 5534; 9-11 years) from the large-scale Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Linear mixed-effect models, after covariate adjustments, identified a positive association (p < 0.05, all |beta s| > 0.01) of excessive PCE (vs. no exposure) with elevated BMI (daily/weekly/daily limit; consistent in boys and girls), increased TSI (daily) and insular thickness (daily/weekly), as well as low middle frontal cortex (MFC) activation (daily). Our sub-analysis revealed an association of daily/weekly PCE (vs. no exposure) with increased gram sugar intake from soft drinks. We also identified a positive relationship of excessive PCE with elevated TSI and increased insular thickness (a key gustatory region), while in a Sobel test, reward sensitivity (reduced brain reactivity to reward anticipation in MFC; tracks reward outcomes) mediated (Test statistic = 2.23; p = 0.02) the PCE-linked BMI changes in adolescents. Our findings suggest that excessive PCE might be detrimental to frontal lobe development and altered reward sensitivity to food, thereby increasing risk for elevated TSI and obesity. Our results support recommendations to limit caffeine intake during pregnancy.

AB Insulin resistance (IR) has an important role in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This study aimed to investigate the effect of young apple (Malus domestica Borkh. cv. Red Fuji) polyphenols (YAP) on IR in HepG2 cells. It was found that YAP and its two main components, phlorizin and chlorogenic acid, could increase glucose uptake, glucose consumption and glycogen content. YAP and phlorizin activated the insulin receptor substrate 2/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/phosphorylation of the protein kinase B (IRS2/PI3K/AKT) signal pathway, as well as its downstream proteins glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), which were further confirmed by application of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. YAP and phlorizin also improved mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, restoring ATP production and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). This study suggested that YAP has the potential to alleviate T2DM symptoms.

However, fruit's chemical composition includes also other components and strongly depends on varieties and climatic conditions. Here, H-1 NMR metabolite profiling and biological activity of four blueberry cultivars (Spartan, Jewels, Misty, Camelia) grown in Central Italy over two years were reported. Untargeted and targeted NMR analyses allowed the quantification of sugars, organic acids, amino acids, anthocyanins, lipids, and other compounds. Spectrophotometric assays evaluated total phenolic and flavonoid content, antioxidant activity, and enzyme inhibitory activity toward cholinesterase, alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and tyrosinase. Statistical analysis showed a correlation between chemical composition and biological activity, revealing markers specific to blueberry cultivars (quinic acid, quercitrin, myo-inositol, myrtillin, and petunidin-3-O-glucoside). Almost all antioxidant assays were correlated with the chlorogenic acid levels. A strong effect of harvesting on chemical composition and biological activities was observed, with Misty cultivar having the highest antioxidant activity.

AB Purpose of ReviewPropolis is a bee product that has been used for thousands of years. The chemical composition and biological activity of propolis, which has been investigated in the twentieth century, may vary according to location. Propolis polyphenols can induce thermogenesis in brown and beige fat tissue via the uncoupled protein-1 and creatinine kinase metabolic pathways. This review provides a comprehensive investigation of the structural and biological properties of propolis and provides insights into their promising potential strategies in body weight management.Recent FindingsBy raising overall energy expenditure, it might lead to body weight management. Furthermore, the phenolic components artepillin C, quercetin, catechin, and chlorogenic acid found in its composition may have anti-obesogenic effect by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system, enhancing browning in white adipose tissue, and triggering AMP-activated protein kinase activation and mitochondrial biogenesis.SummaryPropolis, a natural product, is effective in preventing obesity which is a contemporary pandemic.

AB Aronia (Aronia melanocarpa) contains many polyphenols including cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, and these polyphenols have beneficial effects on lifestyle-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. In type 2 diabetes and obesity model KKA(y) mice, drinking water supplemented with aronia juice reduced blood glucose levels partly through inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) activity by cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside. The objective of this study was to find alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in aronia juice. Polyphenols in aronia juice were first separated using flash chromatography on a reversed-phase column. The fraction with inhibitory activity was further separated using reversed-phase HPLC. Two peak fractions showed inhibitory activity. LC-MS/MS analysis of the fractions indicated that they contained 3-caffeoylquinic acid (3-CQA) and 4-caffeoylquinic acid (4-CQA), respectively. Both CQAs also inhibited DPP IV activity. The results suggest that caffeoylquinic acids in aronia juice are important for the amelioration of type 2 diabetes by the juice.

AB Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption contributes to obesity and chronic disease. SSB intake in children and adolescents remains well above recommendations and reducing intake is challenging. In addition to high sugar content, SSBs are the predominant source of caffeine among youth. However, whether caffeine in SSBs presents unique barriers to reducing consumption is unknown. Herein, we examine parental concerns about child caffeinated-SSB (CSSB) intake and describe parent-reported barriers to lowering their child's consumption. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 21 parents of children and adolescents 8-17 years of age. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded using Nvivo (TM), and key themes were identified. Most parents expressed concern about child CSSB consumption, primarily with regard to dietary (e.g., excess sugar), health (e.g., obesity, diabetes) and/or behavioral (e.g., hyperactivity) consequences of frequent intake. Several key barriers to CSSB restriction were reported, encompassing six emergent themes: widespread availability and accessibility; child non-compliance when asked not to drink CSSBs; peer and cultural influences; negative child response to CSSB restriction; family eating behaviors; and, child preferences for CSSBs versus other beverages. Consideration of these barriers, along with the development of novel approaches to address these challenges, will likely bolster success in interventions aimed at reducing CSSB intake among children and adolescents.

AB Purpose The role of polyphenol intake during adolescence to prevent metabolic syndrome (MetS) is little explored. This study aimed to evaluate the association between intake of total polyphenols, polyphenol classes and the 10 most consumed individual polyphenols with MetS risk in European adolescents. Methods Of the cross-sectional HELENA study, 657 adolescents (54% girls; 14.8% overweight; 12.5-17.5 year) had a fasting blood sample and polyphenol intake data from two non-consecutive 24-h recalls matched with the Phenol-Explorer database. MetS was defined via the pediatric American Heart Association definition. Multilevel linear regressions examined the associations of polyphenol quartiles with MetS components, while logistic regression examined the associations with MetS risk. Results After adjusting for all potential confounders (socio-demographics and nine nutrients), total polyphenol intake, polyphenol classes and individual polyphenols were not associated with MetS risk. From all MetS components, only BMI z-score was modestly inversely associated with total polyphenol intake. Further sub analyses on polyphenol classes revealed that flavonoid intake was significantly associated with higher diastolic blood pressure and lower BMI, and phenolic acid intake was associated with higher low-density cholesterol. For individual polyphenols, the above BMI findings were often confirmed (not independent from dietary intake) and a few associations were found with insulin resistance. Conclusion Higher intakes of total polyphenols and flavonoids were inversely associated with BMI. No consistent associations were found for other MetS components.

AB Aim The present study aims to investigate the composition and availability of weight-loss supplements in Sri Lanka and explore the evidence for their effectiveness.
   Methods Data were collected by visiting drug stores, searching the Internet for websites and referring to advertisements in national newspapers and magazines from August to October 2017.
   Results A total of 100 weight-loss products were identified of which the majority (n = 57) were available from drug stores. Most commonly, products were available in capsule form (36.0%). The number of active ingredients in products varied from 1 to a maximum of 22 with a total of 155 different active ingredients distinguished. The ingredients mainly originated from plants (77.4%) while green tea (Camellia sinensis), garcinia (Garcinia cambogia) and caffeine anhydrous were the three most common. At least one of the top 10 ingredients was included in 75 of the products sourced. Directions for use were specified in only 72 products, while a further 6 products lacked any information on ingredients. Literature predicted positive weight-loss effects for green tea and ginger while garcinia was reported for both positive and negative effects.
   Conclusions The ingredients are reported to have both beneficial and adverse effects. Many consumers may find it challenging to make informed purchase decisions as a number of products failed to provide adequate nutritional information and safety measures. Government regulatory authorities should pay closer attention to the availability and provision of products sold to the general public.

AB This baseline cross-sectional analysis from data acquired in a sub-sample of the PREDIMED-Plus study participants aimed to evaluate the relation between the Composite Socioeconomic Index (CSI) and lifestyle (diet and physical activity). This study involved 1512 participants (759 (52.2%) women) between 55 and 80 years with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome assigned to 137 primary healthcare centers in Catalonia, Spain. CSI and lifestyle (diet and physical activity) were assessed. Multiple linear regression or multinomial regression were applied to the data. Cluster analysis was performed to identify dietary patterns. The multiple linear regression model showed that a high deprivation index was related to a higher consumption of refined cereals (11.98 g/d, p-value = 0.001) and potatoes (6.68 g/d, p-value = 0.001), and to a lower consumption of fruits (-17.52 g/d, p-value = 0.036), and coffee and tea (-8.03 g/d, p-value = 0.013). Two a posteriori dietary patterns were identified by cluster analysis and labeled as "healthy " and "unhealthy ". In addition, the multinomial regression model showed that a high deprivation index was related to an unhealthy dietary pattern and low physical activity (OR 1.42 [95% CI 1.06-1.89]; p-value < 0.05). In conclusion, a high deprivation index was related to an unhealthy lifestyle (diet and physical activity) in PREDIMED-Plus study participants.</p>

TI Strict regulations on energy drinks to protect Minors' health in Europe
   - It is never too late to set things right at home
SO PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Energy drinks; Minors; Health risks; Caffeine; Psychoactive; Stimulant
   effects
AB The consumption of energy drinks poses significant risks to minors' health, and strict regulations are urgently needed to protect them. The high caffeine, high sugar, and high caloric content of energy drinks have drawn concern from health professionals. The consumption of energy drinks has been linked to unhealthy dietary behaviors, obesity, and mental health problems in adolescents. The psychoactive and stimulant effects of energy drinks are particularly worrisome, and the marketing of these drinks on social media platforms is also a cause for alarm. In light of these concerns, we strongly recommend policy measures, such as restrictions on the sale of energy drinks to minors, to prevent their health risks. The evidence clearly suggests that energy drinks pose significant risks to minors' health and well-being, and regulatory standards must be implemented without further delay.

AB Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors that may lead to a more sinister disease. Raised blood pressure, dyslipidemia in the form of elevated triglycerides and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, raised fasting glucose, and central obesity are the risk factors that could lead to full-blown diabetes, heart disease, and many others. With increasing sedentary lifestyles, coupled with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the numbers of people affected with MetS will be expected to grow in the coming years. While keeping these factors checked with the polypharmacy available currently, there is no single strategy that can halt or minimize the effect of MetS to patients. This opens the door for a more natural way of controlling the disease. Caffeic acid (CA) is a phytonutrient belonging to the flavonoids that can be found in abundance in plants, fruits, and vegetables. CA possesses a wide range of beneficial properties from antioxidant, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, neuroprotective, antianxiolytic, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory activities. This review discusses the current discovery of the effect of CA against MetS.

TI Taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their
   consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
LA English
DT Review
AB Background
   Global prevalence of overweight and obesity are alarming. For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes.
   Search methods
   We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies.
   Selection criteria
   We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
   Main results
   We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screeni ng. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax-the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax'- on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine.
   The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to-0.01; very low-certainty evidence).
   The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes.
   The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups.
   We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results.
   Authors' conclusions
   There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very tow. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.

AB Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent metalloproteinases that play important roles in a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and brain diseases. Dietary polyphenols are thought to have a variety of beneficial effects on these diseases characterized by inflammation. Clinical studies have demonstrated that MMPs are in most cases upregulated in various inflammatory diseases, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Studies using patient-derived human samples, animal studies, and cellular experiments have suggested that polyphenols may be beneficial against inflammatory diseases by suppressing MMP gene expression and enzyme activity. One important mechanism by which polyphenols exert their activity is the downregulation of reactive oxygen species that promote MMP expression. Another important mechanism is the direct binding of polyphenols to MMPs and their inhibition of enzyme activity. Molecular docking analyses have provided a structural basis for the interaction between polyphenols and MMPs and will help to explore new polyphenol-based drugs with anti-inflammatory properties.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: The orchid Prosthechea karwinskii is a species endemic to Mexico, which is used in traditional medicine to lower glucose levels in patients with diabetes, and to treat inflammation-related problems. Recent studies have shown that this orchids can reduce glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in Wistar rats, which were previously induced to have metabolic syndrome (MS).
   Aim of the study: To evaluate the effect of P. karwinskii leaves extract on the components of metabolic syndrome: obesity, insulin resistance, pro-inflammatory status, and cardiovascular risk in a Wistar rat model, and to identify the bioactive compounds in the extract.
   Materials and methods: UPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS/MS was used to identify the compounds present in the extract. MS was induced in Wistar rats through administration of a 40% sucrose diet for 20 weeks. The rats were divided into five groups that received different treatments for 4 weeks: one group without any treatment, one group receiving metformin (200 mg/kg p.o.), and three groups receiving different doses of P. karwinskii leaves extract (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg p.o.). The animals' body weights were recorded weekly, and at the end of the experiment, they were sacrificed after fasting for 18 h to determine the levels of glucose, insulin, insulin resistance index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and adiponectin in the serum, as well as levels of TNF-alpha and HS-CRP in the serum and liver homogenates. The abdominal and pericardial fat weights were also recorded.
   Results: The main bioactive compounds of the extract were quinic acid, neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, rutin, kaempferol-3-o-beta-rutinoside, and embelin, known to exhibit MS-related bioactivity. Oral administration of P. karwinskii leaves extract at a dose of 300 mg/kg decreased weight gain, abdominal and pericardial fat deposits, and insulin resistance. At the end of the treatment, levels of triglycerides, TNF-alpha, HS-CRP, and adiponectin returned to levels similar to normal.
   Conclusion: P. karwinskii extract (300 mg/kg) had an anti-obesity effect, decreased insulin resistance, pro inflammatory status, and cardiovascular risk in rats with induced MS by increasing adiponectin levels and decreasing TNF-alpha and HS-CRP levels. The compounds identified in the extract could be responsible for these effects, acting alone or in synergy, as several compounds in the extract are known to have MS-related bioactivity. The foliar extract of P. karwinskii has potential as an effective alternative to a cocktail of drugs used to treat problems associated with MS.

AB Functional foods with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are regarded as a complementary therapy to improve chronic diseases such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Obesity is a chronic low-grade inflammatory state leading to organ damage with increased risk of common diseases including cardiovascular and metabolic disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis and some cancers. IBD is a chronic intestinal inflammation categorised as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis depending on the location of inflammation. These inflammatory states are characterised by normobaric hypoxia in adipose and intestinal tissues, respectively. Tropical foods especially from Australia and South America are discussed in this review to show their potential in attenuation of these chronic diseases. The phytochemicals from these foods have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities to reduce chronic normobaric hypoxia in the tissues. These health benefits of the tropical foods are relevant not only for health economy but also in providing a global solution by improving the sustainability of their cultivation and assisting the local economies.

AB Lemon verbena has been shown to ameliorate obesity-related oxidative stress, but the intracellular final effectors underlying its antioxidant activity are still unknown. The purpose of this study was to correlate the antioxidant capacity of plasma metabolites of lemon verbena (verbascoside, isoverbascoside, hydroxytyrosol, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, homoprotocatechuic acid, and luteolin-7-diglucuronide) with their uptake and intracellular metabolism in hypertrophic adipocytes under glucotoxic conditions. To this end, intracellular ROS levels were measured, and the intracellular metabolites were identified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). The results showed that the plasma metabolites of lemon verbena are absorbed by adipocytes and metabolized through phase II reactions and that the intracellular appearance of these metabolites correlates with the decrease in the level of glucotoxicity-induced oxidative stress. It is postulated that the biotransformation and accumulation of these metabolites in adipocytes contribute to the long-term antioxidant activity of the extract.

AB Flowers of Prunus persica (L.) Batsch (Rosaceae), known as peach blossoms, have been reported to exert anti-obesity effects by improving hepatic lipid metabolism in obese mice. However, little is known regarding the anti-adipogenic effects of the phenolic compounds isolated from P. persica flowers. This study investigated the inhibitory effects of compounds extracted from P. persica flowers (PPF) on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 murine preadipocytes using adipogenic differentiation assays. Additionally, we compared the anti-adipogenic effects of the phenolic compounds isolated from PPF, such as prunasin amide (1), amygdalin amide (2), prunasin acid (3), mandelamide (4), methyl caffeate (5), ferulic acid (6), chlorogenic acid (7), benzyl alpha-L-xylpyranosyl-(1 -> 6)-beta-D- glucopyranoside (8), prunin (9), naringenin (10), nicotiflorin (11), astragalin (12), afzelin (13), and uridine (14), on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 murine preadipocytes. PPF and compounds 4-7 and 10 significantly inhibited adipogenesis. Among them, mandelamide (4) exhibited the maximum inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 36.04 +/- 1.82 mu M. Additionally, mandelamide downregulated the expression of key adipogenic markers, such as extra cellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, P38, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, and glucocorticoid receptor. These results indicate that mandelamide is an active ingredient of PPF possessing anti-obesity properties.

AB This study aimed to identify major dietary patterns associated with abdominal obesity in middle-aged and older Korean adults. Data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were used. A total of 48,037 Korean adults aged >40 years without abdominal obesity at baseline were followed-up. Dietary assessment was conducted using a validated 106-item food-frequency questionnaire, and dietary patterns were identified using factor analysis. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference of >90 cm for men and >85 cm for women, according to the Korean Society for the Study of Obesity. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the future risk of abdominal obesity for each dietary pattern after adjusting for potential covariates. After an average follow-up of 4.89 years, we reported 5878 cases (1932 men and 3946 women) of abdominal obesity.Based on factor analysis, three major dietary patterns were identified in both men and women: the "healthy", "coffee and sweets", and "multi-grain" patterns. In the fully adjusted model, the "healthy" pattern was inversely associated with the incidence of abdominal obesity (HR for fourth vs. first quartile: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.75-0.98; p for trend = 0.0358 for men; HR for fourth vs. first quartile: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83-0.99; p for trend = 0.0188 for women), whereas the "coffee and sweets" pattern was positively associated with it (HR for fourth vs. first quartile: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.08-1.40; p for trend = 0.0495 for men; HR for fourth vs. first quartile: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.04-1.25; p for trend = 0.0096 for women). In contrast, the "multi-grain" pattern in men and women showed no significant association with the incidence of abdominal obesity. Diets rich in colorful vegetables, seaweeds, mushrooms, tubers, fruits, soy products, and fish and low in coffee, sweets, and oils/fats might be favorable for reducing the future risk of abdominal obesity, particularly in middle-aged and older Korean adults.

AB Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers. water extract (EAW) was investigated for its anti-obesity effects in C57BL/6J mice on a high-fat diet. Mice were divided into groups fed normal and high-fat diets (ND and HFD, respectively), and HFD mice were treated with EAW (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Inhibition of HFD-induced obesity by EAW was evaluated using biochemical parameters, immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, and immunoblot assay. EAW supplementation significantly diminished the final body weight, adipose tissue size, and epididymal adipose tissue volume compared with mice with obesity induced by HFD (p < 0.05 for all). EAW also decreased serum triglyceride (TG) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) levels in obese mice. EAW attenuated HFD-induced obesity by down-regulating C/EBP alpha, PPAR gamma, and SREBP-1c to suppress adipogenesis. Moreover, this study indicated that EAW activates the AMPK pathway and increases ACC phosphorylation and downstream CPT1 expression in HFD-induced obese mice. Furthermore, several phenolic acids with anti-obesity properties have been identified in EAW, including quinic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid. Based on these data, EAW has anti-obesity effects in vivo, which indicates that it is an excellent candidate for the development of anti-obesity functional foods.

AB Due to the growing problem of obesity associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, causes of obesity are extensively investigated. In addition to a high caloric diet and low physical activity, gut microbiota disturbance may have a potential impact on excessive weight gain. Some reports indicate differences in the composition of the intestinal microflora of obese people in comparison to lean. Bioactive compounds of natural origin with beneficial and multifaceted effects on the body are more frequently used in prevention and treatment of many metabolic diseases including obesity.Sideritis scardicais traditionally consumed as mountain tea in the Balkans to strengthen the body and improve mood. Many reports indicate a positive effect on digestive system, weight loss, and prevention of insulin resistance. Additionally, it exhibits antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory effects. The positive effect ofSideritis scardicaextracts on memory and general cognitive abilities is indicated as well. The multilevel positive effect on the body appears to originate from the abundant occurrence of phenolic compounds, especially phenolic acids inSideritis scardicaextracts. However, mechanisms underlying their action require careful discussion and further research. Therefore, the objective of this review is to summarize the available knowledge on the role and mechanism of action of biologically active compounds ofSideritis scardicaand other related species from the genusSideritis.

AB In this study, the anti-obesity effect and mechanism of action of Viburnim opulus fruit crude extract (CE) and semi-purified phenolic extract (SPPE) in 3T3-L1 cells were studied. In addition, inhibitory activity of extracts against pancreatic lipase in triolein emulsion was estimated, as well as their phenolic profiles by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS. Twenty four phenolic compounds were identified in both extracts with chlorogenic acid as the dominant compound. The inhibition mode of extracts against lipase was competitive and SPPE demonstrated synergistic action with orlistat. Both extracts had the ability to inhibit adipogenesis process in a dose-dependent manner. Cells treatment with extracts at 75 mu g/mL concentration was not only sufficient to inhibit lipids accumulation at almost 20%, but also influenced the size of lipid droplets. CE and SPPE reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species production by 20% and leptin level by 21-30%. They did not affect the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and adiponectin protein expression levels.

AB The pharmacological treatments that are now recommended for the therapy of chronic illnesses are examined in a great number of studies to determine whether or not they are both safe and effective. Therefore, it is important to investigate various alternative therapeutic assistance, such as natural remedies derived from medicinal plants. In this context, chicoric acid, classified as a hydroxycinnamic acid, has been documented to exhibit a range of health advantages. These include antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, obesity-preventing, and neuroprotective effects. Due to its considerable pharmacological properties, chicoric acid has found extensive applications in food, pharmaceuticals, animal husbandry, and various other commercial sectors. This article provides a comprehensive overview of in vitro and in vivo investigations on chicoric acid, highlighting its beneficial effects and therapeutic activity when used as a preventative and management aid for public health conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hepatic illnesses like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Moreover, further investigation of this compound can lead to its development as a potential phytopharmaceutical candidate.

AB The aim of the present study was to explore the influence of tea consumption on diabetes mellitus in the Chinese population. This multi-centre, cross-sectional study was conducted in eight sites from south, east, north, west and middle regions in China by enrolling 12 017 subjects aged 20-70 years. Socio-demographic and general information was collected by a standardised questionnaire. A standard procedure was used to measure anthropometric characteristics and to obtain blood samples. The diagnosis of diabetes was determined using a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. In the final analysis, 10 825 participants were included and multiple logistic models and interaction effect analysis were applied for assessing the association between tea drinking with diabetes. Compared with non-tea drinkers, the multivariable-adjusted OR for newly diagnosed diabetes were 0 center dot 80 (95 % CI 0 center dot 67, 0 center dot 97), 0 center dot 88 (95 % CI 0 center dot 71, 1 center dot 09) and 0 center dot 86 (95 % CI 0 center dot 67, 1 center dot 11) for daily tea drinkers, occasional tea drinkers and seldom tea drinkers, respectively. Furthermore, drinking tea daily was related to decreased risk of diabetes in females by 32 %, elderly (>45 years) by 24 % and obese (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) by 34 %. Moreover, drinking dark tea was associated with reduced risk of diabetes by 45 % (OR 0 center dot 55; 95 % CI 0 center dot 42, 0 center dot 72; P < 0 center dot 01). The results imply that drinking tea daily was negatively related to risk of diabetes in female, elderly and obese people. In addition, drinking dark tea was associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB Meal replacement products are normally consumed in weight-loss interventions and the treatment of obesity and diabetes. Changing lifestyles and eating habits made meal replacement products in the forms of shakes and bars a good alternative as To-go-meals, promoted as balanced in its composition and thus healthier compared to other ready-to-eat meals. This study aimed to evaluate the bioactivity of six differently flavoured powdered meal replacement products. Their analysis was made by a ten-dimensional hyphenation composed of digestion on the adsorbent surface, followed by normal-phase high-performance thin-layer chromatographic separation, multi-imaging, and planar assay application (effect-directed analysis), and then heart-cut elution/transfer of bioactive compound zones to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, diode array detection, and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The on-surface digestion of saccharides, fats, and proteins through intestinal enzymatic activity revealed new breakdown products. These exhibited bioactivity in their different effect-profiles obtained by the Gram-negative Aliivibrio fischeri bioassay as well as alpha-/beta-glucosidase and acetyl-/butyrylcholinesterease inhibition assays. The main bioactive compounds arising through simulated static pancreatic digestion were saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids. The synthetic sweetener sucralose was not influenced by simulated static intestinal digestion, but showed antimicrobial activity. In the prepared drinking meals with coffee and choco flavour, the acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting methylxanthines caffeine and theobromine were identified as bioactive compounds. Some other bioactive constituents could not be assigned to specific molecules and require further analyses. Although the studied meal replacement products showed health-beneficial properties through antimicrobial properties or inhibition of enzymes involved in the expression of the civilisation diseases, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, plant foods, herbs and spices have been shown to be even richer and more versatile in bioactive compounds.

AB Background/objectives Few studies have evaluated the effects of energy drinks on allergic diseases. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the association between energy drinks and various allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, in a large representative Korean adolescent population. Subjects/methods This cross-sectional study used data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey collected from 2015 to 2016. A total of 129,809 participants (n = 67,056 for males; n = 62,753 for females) aged 12-18 years were included and were asked about their frequency of consumption of energy drinks such as Hot6(R), Redbull(R), and Bacchus(R). Their history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis throughout life and in the last 12 months were obtained. The association between the frequency of energy-drink consumption and allergic diseases was analyzed using multiple logistic regression with adjustment for various covariates. Results Age, sex, physical activity, obesity, region of residence, economic level, paternal and maternal educational level, smoking, and alcohol consumption differed significantly according to the frequency of energy-drink consumption (each P < 0.001). Frequent energy-drink consumption (>= 7 times a week) was significantly associated with asthma throughout life (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.64, P = 0.025), asthma within the last 12 months (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.16-2.35, P = 0.006), allergic rhinitis within the last 12 months (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.02-1.44, P = 0.030), and atopic dermatitis within the last 12 months (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.17-1.90, P = 0.001) compared to no energy-drink consumption in the full-adjusted model. Conclusions Frequent energy-drink consumption is associated with allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, in Korean adolescents.

TI Is breakfast consumption detrimental, unnecessary, or an opportunity for

AB Breakfast consumption is generally considered a health-promoting habit for cardiometabolism, particularly with regard to chrononutrition. Glucose uptake is enhanced by proper insulin secretion triggered by the pancreatic clock, averting metabolic dysregulation related to insulin resistance. Breakfast skipping, in turn, is often considered a behaviour detrimental to health, in part due to putative inverse metabolic actions compared to breakfast consumption, such that breakfast skipping may promote circadian desynchrony. However, most ill health concerns about breakfast skipping are inferred from observational research, and recent well-controlled randomized clinical trials have shown benefits of breakfast skipping for cardiovascular risk factors. Accordingly, this review describes the effects of breakfast consumption versus breakfast skipping on cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and glycaemic and lipid indices). In addition, the view of breakfast consumption as an opportunity for functional food ingestion is considered to provide further insights into decision-making practice. Collectively, both breakfast consumption and breakfast skipping can be considered viable habits, but they depend on individual preferences, planning, and the specific foods being consumed or omitted. When consumed, breakfast should consist primarily of functional foods typical for this meal (e.g., eggs, dairy products, nuts, fruits, whole grains, coffee, tea, etc.). While breakfast consumption aligns with chrononutrition principles, breakfast skipping can contribute to a calorie deficit over time, which has the potential for widespread cardiometabolic benefits for patients with overweight/obesity. The concepts and practical considerations discussed in the present review may aid health care personnel in personalising breakfast consumption recommendations for diverse patient populations.

AB Objective Identifying associations among circulating proteins, dietary intakes, and clinically relevant indicators of cardiometabolic health during weight loss may elucidate biologically relevant pathways affected by diet, allowing for an incorporation of precision nutrition approaches when designing future interventions. This study hypothesized that plasma proteins would be associated with diet and cardiometabolic health indicators within a behavioral weight-loss intervention. Methods This secondary data analysis included participants (n = 20, mean [SD], age: 40.1 [9.5] years, BMI: 34.2 [4.0] kg/m(2)) who completed a 1-year behavioral weight-loss intervention. Cardiovascular disease-related plasma proteins, diet, and cardiometabolic health indicators were evaluated at baseline and 3 months. Associations were determined via linear regression and integrated networks created using Visualization Of LineAr Regression Elements (VOLARE). Results A total of 16 plasma proteins were associated with >= 1 diet or health indicator at baseline (p < 0.001); changes in 42 proteins were associated with changes in diet or health indicators from baseline to 3 months (p < 0.005). Baseline tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10C (TNFRSF10C) was associated with intakes of dark green vegetables (r = -0.712), and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) was associated with intakes of unsweetened coffee (r = -0.689). Changes in refined-grain intakes were associated with changes in scavenger receptor cysteine-rich type 1 protein M130 (CD163; r = 0.725), interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL1R-T1; r = 0.624), insulin (r = 0.656), and triglycerides (r = 0.648). Conclusions Circulating cardiovascular disease-related proteins were associated with diet and cardiometabolic health indicators prior to and in response to weight loss.

AB Globally, the high consumption levels of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and their effect on health have drawn significant attention. This study aimed to identify the consumption patterns of SSBs among children in rural areas of Guangzhou, China, and explore their association with undernutrition. A total of 1864 children aged 9-17 years old were included in this study. Demographics, lifestyle behaviors, and anthropometric and dietary information were collected. Factor analysis was used to identify patterns of SSBs, while nutritional status was assessed using Body Mass Index (BMI). Latent class analysis was used to establish dietary preference models. Log-binomial regression analysis was used to analyze the association between SSBs consumption patterns and undernutrition. The undernutrition prevalence in children was 14.54-19.94% in boys and 9.07% in girls. Three SSB consumption patterns were identified, including the plant protein pattern, dairy-containing pattern, and coffee pattern. Both medium-high (Q3) and the highest (Q4) scores in the dairy-containing pattern were positively associated with the risk of undernutrition, especially in boys. Furthermore, the highest scores in the plant protein pattern and coffee pattern were positively associated with the risk of undernutrition in children aged 9-10 years old. The dairy-containing pattern was a risk factor for undernutrition in children, especially for boys; the plant protein patterns and coffee patterns were risk factors for undernutrition in children aged 9-10 years old. The findings of the study can provide scientific evidence and policy recommendations for improving children's health conditions.

AB This study examined the effects of calorie labelling and two key contextual factors (reflective motivation and habits) on the calorie content of hypothetical coffee-shop menu choices. In one exploratory (n = 70) and one preregistered (n = 300) laboratory study (Studies 1 and 2 respectively), participants viewed a hypothetical calorie-labelled or non calorie-labelled menuboard and selected their preferred item(s). Coffee shop drinking habits were measured using the Self-Report Habit Index, and reflective motivation (relating to calorie intake) was assessed with three items asking about watching weight, eating healthily, and reading calorie labels. In Study 2, participants also estimated calories contained in a subset of the menuboard drinks. Results of both studies showed that labelling did not significantly affect the total calorie content of items selected. However, in Study 2, as predicted, there was a trend toward moderation by reflective motivation (p = .056) with less motivated participants showing relatively greater calorie selection when exposed to labelling. Participants with weaker habits took longer to select items (p = .002) but, contrary to predictions, were not more influenced by labelling. Higher reflective motivation was associated with selecting fewer calories (p = .002), correctly recalling the presence/ absence of labelling (p = .016) and better estimating calorie content (p < .001). Overall, participants significantly underestimated calories in higher calorie drinks but overestimated calories in lower calorie drinks. The results highlight the importance of contextual factors such as habits and reflective motivation for obesity interventions and are relevant for the UK's introduction of selective mandatory calorie labelling. In some instances, labelling may actually increase intake among those less motivated by health and weight concerns, but further research is needed to substantiate this concern.

AB The purpose of this paper was to present the results of the evaluation of 1320 adolescents from 4 high schools in Iasi, Romania regarding their eating habits and perceived benefits of physical activity and body attractiveness after they completed an anonymous questionnaire. The data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 18. The analysis of the nutritional status showed that over 70% of adolescents were of a normal weight. Most of them (63.56%) consumed 3-4 meals/day, with breakfast being the most skipped meal (60.53%). Compared with the boys, the girls consumed fewer whole grains, dairy products, and meat, but the girls consumed fruits and vegetables in approximately the same percentage. The adolescents studied consumed more fruits than vegetables, but the servings of fruits and vegetables consumed were not sufficient in the diets of many adolescents (39.31%). Among the adolescents, 5.68% consumed at least 2 alcoholic drinks daily, and 37.87% consumed caffeine products one or more times per week. Among the boys, 95.20% practiced regular physical activity, and 97.20% of the girls considered that the right nutrition plays a role in the prevention of obesity. The study of the self-perception profile showed that 89.8% of boys and 79.5% of girls considered that they had attractive bodies. According to the BMI, 86.7% of normal-weight adolescents and 84.8% of underweight adolescents considered themselves as having attractive bodies, while this was only considered by 73.5% of overweight and 56.7% of obese adolescents. It is necessary to introduce nutritional education in schools for the improvement of eating habits in children and adolescents. More studies are needed to appreciate the social behaviors (e.g., food intake, physical activity, and recreation time) and then develop interventions and national health programs to promote a healthy lifestyle, particularly healthy eating habits.

ID EXTRACT; THERMOGENESIS; LEAVES
AB Mulberry leaf is an important medicinal food plant, which is rich in polyphenol compounds. Mulberry leaf polyphenols (MLP) possess significant lipid-lowering and antioxidant effects, and healthcare functions. In this study, the polyphenol content of mulberry leaf ethanol extract was measured using HPLC. The analysis of mulberry leaf extract resulted in the identification of 14 compounds, of which Chlorogenic acid and Quercitrin were the highest. A high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model was developed and treated with MLP for 12 weeks to explore their effect on lipid metabolism in HFD-induced obese mice. The results showed that the MLP could inhibit the weight gain and fat cell volume increase in the HFD-induced obese mice in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis revealed that the MLP decelerated the fatty acid composition in the adipose tissues of HFD-induced obese mice, and significantly increased the polyunsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid (PUFA/SFA) ratio. The real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results indicated that the MLP significantly inhibited the down regulation of uncoupling protein (UCP) 1 (UCP1), UCP3, and PR domain zinc finger protein 16 (PRDM16) caused by the HFD. These beneficial effects of MLP on HFD-induced obese mice might be attributed to their ability to change the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue and increase the expression of thermogenesis genes. Overall, the study results suggested that the MLP could serve as potential lipid-lowering and weight-loss functional food and healthcare products.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Cynara cardunculus leaf ethanol extract on inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters in the hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cerebral cortex and liver of high-fat diet-induced obese mice. Food intake, body weight, visceral fat weight, and liver weight were also evaluated. Male Swiss mice were divided into control (low-fat purified diet) and obese (high-fat purified diet) groups. After 6 weeks, mice were divided into control + saline, control + C. cardunculus leaf ethanol extract, obese + saline, obese + C. cardunculus leaf ethanol extract. Cynara cardunculus leaf ethanol extract (1600 mg/kg/day) or saline was administered orally for 4 weeks. Brain structures (hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebral cortex) and liver were removed. Treatment with C. cardunculus leaf ethanol extract did not affect body weight but did reduce visceral fat. Obesity can cause inflammation and oxidative stress and increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes in brain structures. Treatment with ethanolic extract of C. cardunculus leaves partially reversed the changes in inflammatory damage parameters and oxidative damage parameters and attenuated changes in the antioxidant defense. The C. cardunculus leaf ethanol extract benefited from the brains of obese animals by partially reversing the changes caused by the consumption of a high-fat diet and the consequent obesity. These results corroborate those of studies indicating that the C. cardunculus leaf ethanol extract can contribute to the treatment of obesity.

AB Polyphenol is one of the most essential phytochemicals with various health benefits. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is known as a potential source of polyphenols, and also has health benefits in which phenolic acids, such as chlorogenic, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, sustainably play the most significant role. Almost every polyphenol contributes to various biological activities. In this review, we collected comprehensive information concerning the diversity of polyphenols in potatoes, and the effects of post-harvest processing and different cooking methods on the bioavailability of polyphenols. To achieve maximum health benefits, the selection of potato cultivars is necessary by choosing their colors, but various cooking methods are also very important in obtaining the maximum concentration of polyphenolic compounds. The health properties including major biological activities of polyphenols, such as antioxidant activity, anticarcinogenic activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-obesity activity, and antidiabetic activity, have also been summarized. All these biological activities of polyphenols in potatoes might be helpful for breeders in the design of new varieties with many health benefits, and are expected to play a vital role in both pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries.

AB The study investigated the effects of Petasites japonicus (Siebold & Zucc.) Maxim. extract (PJE) and fenofibrate on diet-induced obesity (DIO) in mice. PJE was found to contain various bio-active polyphenolic compounds, including kaempferol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, rutin, protocatechuic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, p-coumaric acid, apigenin, and 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid. The results showed that PJE treatment up to 1000 mu g/mL did not affect the viability of 3T3-L1 cell line, and it reduced the feed efficiency ratio in DIO mice. PJE administration also resulted in a significant reduction in body weight gain and fat accumulation in the liver compared to the DIO control group. Additionally, PJE administration improved the levels of lipid and related parameters, including total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, leptin, and atherogenic or cardiac indexes compared to the DIO control group. The study suggested that PJE may have a beneficial effect on insulin resistance, lipid profiles, atherogenesis, adipokines, and cardiac risk associated with diet-induced obesity.

AB Barnyard millet (Echinochloa frumantacea L.) is a traditional South Indian dietary staple known for its short grain ripening period of 45 days. Various processing methods are employed to enhance its nutrient quality, aid digestion, and improve bioavailability by reducing anti-nutrients. This study aimed to compare the nutritional properties of barnyard millet processed through different methods, including whole flour, de-husked flour, and roasted flour. Samples were collected from different regions in Tamil Nadu, namely Chennai, Kovilpatti, and Virudhunagar. Subsequently, they underwent maceration extraction using methanol to evaluate their nutritional, antioxidant, and anti-nutritional properties. Phytochemical analysis revealed elevated levels of selected compounds in all samples, with processing methods resulting in a reduction of anti-nutrient content. Notably, the roasted sample from Chennai exhibited significant antioxidant activity, while de-husked flour from Chennai and Kovilpatti regions demonstrated inhibition of in vitro anti-obesity activity. RP-HPLC analysis identified major metabolites, and molecular docking against oxidoreductase proteins highlighted the efficacy of Chlorogenic acid and Gallic acid. These findings suggest the potential for developing novel therapeutic drugs for diabetes and anti-cancer health benefits associated with specific barnyard millet processing methods.

AB Owing to their antioxidant properties, caffeoylquinic acid (CQA)-derivatives could potentially improve the impaired metabolism in hepatic cells, however, their effect on mitochondrial function has not been demonstrated yet. Here, we evaluated the impact of three CQA-derivatives extracted from purple sweet potato, namely 5-CQA, 3,4- and 4,5-diCQA, on mitochondrial activity in primary hepatocytes using an extracellular flux analyzer. Notably, an increase of maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity were observed when 5-CQA and 3,4-diCQA were added to the system indicating the improved mitochondrial function. Moreover, 3,4-diCQA was shown to considerably increase glycolytic reserve which is a measure of cell capability to respond to an energy demand through glycolysis. Conversely, 4,5-diCQA did not modify mitochondrial activity but increased glycolysis at low concentration in primary hepatocytes. All compounds tested improved cellular capacity to oxidize fatty acids. Overall, our results demonstrated the potential of test CQA-derivatives to modify mitochondrial function in hepatic cells. It is especially relevant in case of dysfunctional mitochondria in hepatocytes linked to hepatic steatosis during obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

AB Obesity, a public health problem and a risk factor for numerous comorbidities, has stimulated a growing interest in bioactive-rich foods, such as guarana (Paullinia cupana). This systematic review examined the impact of guarana on obesity-related diseases using animal models from January 1990 and November 2023. Seven articles were included in this review, examining guarana's impact on hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. The studies used powdered guarana, provided by orogastric gavage or incorporated into the diet, with doses ranging from 12.5 mg/kg to 2 g/kg. Compelling evidence from our systematic review suggests that guarana powder positively affects biometric parameters, energy metabolism, and biochemical and inflammatory biomarkers, indicating its potential for addressing obesity-related conditions. However, due to the limited number of studies, additional research, including human, clinical trials, is needed to confirm the applicability of these findings to human health and to clarify the mechanisms of action of guarana's bioactive compounds.

TI Stress eating: an online survey of eating behaviours, comfort foods, and
   healthy food substitutes in German adults
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English

ID SELECTION; CHOICES
AB Background: In many people, stress is associated with changes in eating behaviour. Food products consumed during stress (comfort foods) are often unhealthy. It is rather unknown what comfort foods are consumed in Germany and what healthier food products are considered as alternatives to support stress-eaters in making healthier food choices.
   Methods: This online survey was conducted in spring 2021 throughout Germany. Participants were digitally recruited by newsletters, homepages, social media, and mailing lists. The survey included a standardized questionnaire with items concerning e.g. sociodemography, stress, and nutrition. Comfort foods were pre-selected through literature search and food substitutes were defined and discussed by experts. Analyses examined comfort food consumption and substitute preferences dependent on sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and being a self-identified stress-eater. The statistical analysis was performed using R.
   Results: Survey participants were mostly female (80.6%, 994/1234), had a mean age of 31.4 +/- 12.8 years and a mean BMI of 23.4 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2). Participants stated, that the two favourite comfort foods were chocolate (consumed often/very often by 48.3%, 596/1234) and coffee (consumed often/very often by 45.9%, 566/1234). Regarding food substitutes, the most frequently named alternative food for chocolate and cookies was fresh fruits (for chocolate: 74.4%, 815/1096, for cookies: 62.6%, 565/902). Tea without added sugar (64.4%, 541/840) was the preferred substitute for coffee. Almost 50% of participants (48.1%, 594/1234) identified themselves as stress-eaters, of which 68.9% (408/592) stated to eat (very) often more than usual in subjective stress situations.
   Conclusions: The results from this work suggest that specific comfort foods and substitutes are preferred by the participants in stressful situations. This knowledge about food choices and substitutes should be investigated in further studies to improve eating behaviour in stressful situations.

AB Background Laboratory and animal studies suggest an inverse association between chocolate consumption and the risk of cancer. Epidemiological studies have yielded inconsistent evidence.
   Objective To assess the association of chocolate candy consumption with incident, invasive total, breast, colorectal, and lung cancers in a large cohort of postmenopausal American women.
   Design Prospective cohort study with a mean 14.8-year follow-up. Chocolate candy intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Invasive cancer events were assessed by physician adjudication.
   Participants/setting The Women's Health Initiative Study enrolled 161,808 postmenopausal women at 40 clinical centers nationwide between 1993 and 1998. Of these women, 114,281 with plausible food frequency or biometric data and no missing data on chocolate candy exposure were selected for analysis.
   Main outcome measures Cancer risk in quartiles of chocolate candy consumption with the first quartile as referent.
   Statistical analyses Multivariable Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
   Results There were 16,164 documented incident invasive cancers, representing an incidence rate of 17.0 per 100 participants and 12.3 per 1000 person years during follow-up among participants without any preexisting cancers or missing outcome data. There were no statistically significant associations for total invasive cancer (P-linear = .47, P-curvature = .14), or invasive breast cancer (P-linear = .77, P-curvature = .26). For colorectal cancer P-linear was .02, P-curvature was .03, and compared with women eating a 1 oz (28.4 g) chocolate candy serving <1 time per month, the hazard ratio for >= 1.5 times/ wk was 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.35). This result may be attributable to the excess adiposity associated with frequent chocolate candy consumption.
   Conclusions In the Women's Health Initiative, there was no significant association between chocolate candy consumption and invasive total or breast cancer. There was a modest 18% higher risk of invasive colorectal cancer for women who ate chocolate candy at least 1.5 times/wk. These results require confirmation.

AB Background & aims: Tea has been shown to be associated with reduced risk of several diseases including cardiovascular diseases, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. However, the results on the relation-ship between tea consumption and bladder cancer are conflicting. This research aimed to assess the association between tea consumption and risk of bladder cancer using a pooled analysis of prospective cohort data. Methods: Individual data from 532,949 participants in 12 cohort studies, were pooled for analyses. Cox regression models stratified by study centre was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% CIs. Fractional polynomial regression models were used to examine the dose-response relationship. Results: A higher level of tea consumption was associated with lower risk of bladder cancer incidence (compared with no tea consumption: HR = 0.87, 95% C.I. = 0.77-0.98 for low consumption; HR = 0.86, 95% C.I. = 0.77-0.96 for moderate consumption; HR = 0.84, 95% C.I. = 0.75-0.95 for high consumption). When stratified by sex and smoking status, this reduced risk was statistically significant among men and current and former smokers. In addition, dose-response analyses showed a lower bladder cancer risk with increment of 100 ml of tea consumption per day (HR-increment = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.96-0.98). A similar inverse association was found among males, current and former smokers while never smokers and females showed non-significant results, suggesting potential sex-dependent effect. Conclusions: Higher consumption of tea is associated with reduced risk of bladder cancer with potential interaction with sex and smoking status. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms for a protective effect of tea (e.g. inhibition of the survival and proliferation of cancer cells and antiinflammatory mechanisms) and its interaction with smoking and sex.

AB Chlorogenic acids (CGAs) have gained considerable attention as pervasive human dietary constituents with potential cardiovascular-preserving effects. The main sources include coffee, yerba mate, Eucommia ulmodies leaves, and Lonicerae Japonicae Flos. CGA consumption can reduce the risks of hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and other factors associated with cardiovascular risk, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. This review recapitulates recent advances of CGAs in the cardiovascular-preserving effects, pharmacokinetics, sources, and safety. Emerging evidence indicates that CGAs exhibit circulatory guarding properties through the suppression of oxidative stress, leukocyte infiltration, platelet aggregation, platelet-leukocyte interactions, vascular remodeling, and apoptosis as well as the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism and vasodilatory action in the cardiovascular system. CGAs exert these effects by acting on complex signaling networks, but the global mechanisms are still not clear. The oral bioavailability of CGA is poor, and there is a potential sensitization concern about CGA.

TI Chlorogenic Acids Inhibit Adipogenesis: Implications of
   Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY

DT Article
ID 3T3-L1 CELL-DIFFERENTIATION; METABOLISM; ACCUMULATION; OBESITY
AB In our previous in vitro study, we found that chlorogenic acid (CGA) inhibited adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride (TG) accumulation, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Accumulative genetic evidence supports that canonical Wnt signaling is a key modulator on adipogenesis. Methods. In this study, 3T3-L1 cells were induced adipogenic differentiation and then treated with CGA. We investigate the effect of CGA in inhibiting adipogenesis and evaluate its role in modulating Wnt10b (wingless integration1 10b), beta-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) involved in the Wnt (wingless integration1)/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Results. The result showed that after CGA treatment, lipid accumulation and TG level decreased significantly in 3T3-L1 cells, indicating that CGA could inhibit adipogenesis. In addition, CGA repressed the induction of adipocyte differentiation biomarkers as PPAR-gamma, adipocyte protein 2 (aP2), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and the secretion of GSK-3 beta in a dose-dependent manner upregulated the expression of beta-catenin and Wnt10b both in gene and protein levels. Moreover, CGA induced phosphorylation of GSK-3 beta and promoted the accumulation of free cytosolic beta-catenin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Conclusion. Overall, these findings gave us the implications that CGA inhibits adipogenesis via the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

AB Examining the composition of breakfast concerning weight status is essential for evaluating adolescent health and understanding this gap. This study aimed to identify breakfast patterns and investigate the relationship with weight status among Brazilian adolescents. We used a subsample of 7425 adolescents aged 10-19 years from the 2008-2009 Brazilian Household Budget Survey. Breakfast eaters were those with intake of at least 50 kcal (209 center dot 2 kJ) between 05.00 and 10.00 hours. Breakfast dietary patterns were derived by principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation. We performed logistic regression analyses between breakfast patterns and weight status, considering the complexity of the survey sample design. Three breakfast patterns were identified explaining 44 center dot 8 % of data variability: (1) the Cereal, protein, fruit beverages and Northern/Northeastern pattern, characterised by high consumption of cookies, meats, dairy products, preparations with maize, eggs, fruit juices/fruit drinks/soya-based drinks, tubers/roots/potatoes and cereals, and negative adherence to cold cut meat and savoury snacks/crackers; (2) the Protein-based pattern, characterised by positive loadings for cold cut meat, milk and cheese, and negative for cookies, fruit juices/fruit drinks/soya-based drinks, tubers/roots/potatoes and cereals; and (3) the Mixed pattern, with positive loadings for cakes, coffee/tea, bread, fruit juices/fruit drinks/soya-based drinks, chocolate/desserts and savoury snacks/crackers. No association was found between skipping and weight status. Overweight adolescents had lower adherence to the Cereal, protein, fruit beverages and Northern/Northeastern pattern (OR = 0 center dot 67; 95 % CI 0 center dot 47, 0 center dot 96). This is the first study to address dietary patterns at the meal level with adolescent population-based data, which requires further investigation.

AB Diabetes is an important global health concern. According to the World Health Organization, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has 2.8 to 4.3 million diabetic patients between the ages of 27 to 60 in the year 2022. Medical nutrition therapy an essential component of diabetes management, helps improve diabetes outcomes by assisting patients in achieving a target glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of <7. This study aimed to describe the pattern of food consumption in the study population and determine its association with glycemic control. This was a cross-sectional study among health facility attendees at the Endocrinology and Diabetes Center (EDC) in Jazan, KSA. A total of 315 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were enrolled using a systematic random sampling technique. Sociodemographic and dietary habit information gathered through face-to-face interviews, anthropometric measurements, and HbA1c were collected from medical records. Participants were mostly females (55.6%), and more than half of them were above 50 years of age. More than 90% of the patients had poor HbA1c levels, and 2-thirds of the patients were overweight and obese (43.8% and 37.1%, respectively). The most consumed foods were bread (8 times/week) and coffee/tea and vegetables (7 times per week), and the least consumed was soda beverages (once/week). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the consumption of fruits (consumed 5 times/week) significantly decreased HbA1c, while the consumption of pastries/pizza (consumed twice/week) significantly increased it. The pattern of consumption of fruits and vegetables in the study population conformed to the recommended levels, and that of fruits showed a statistically significant association with the control of HbA1c. Another food item that has a significant negative effect on HbA1c is pastries/pizza. Further studies that include more potentially confounding variables, such as treatment type, are needed.

AB BackgroundDietary indices and scores are valuable predictive markers against chronic diseases. Several previous studies have revealed the beneficial effects of diabetes risk reduction score (DRRS) against diabetes and cancer incidence. However, its association with metabolic abnormalities among obese individuals have not been revealed before. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the association between DRRS and metabolic risk factors among obese individuals.MethodsIn the current cross-sectional study, 342 obese individuals [Body mass index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m(2)] aged 20-50 years were included. Dietary intake was assessed by a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) of 168 food items and DRRS was calculated. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined based on the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III). Enzymatic methods were used to assess serum lipids, glucose, and insulin concentrations. Blood pressure was measured by a sphygmomanometer and body composition with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).ResultsThose with a higher adherence to DRRS had a significantly higher intake of energy, fiber, and lower protein compared with those in the lower quartiles. Moreover, lower intakes of trans fats, meat, sugar sweetened beverages (SSB), and glycemic index (GI) with higher intakes of fruits, cereal fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids/ saturated fatty acids (PUFA/ SFA) ratio, coffee, and nuts were observed in the highest versus lowest DRRS categories. Lower systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride and, higher high-density lipoprotein values were observed in higher DRRS categories. Logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension was significantly associated with adherence to DRRS among obese individuals, the odds ratio (OR) was 0.686 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.84) after adjustment for potential confounders. But the risk of other components of MetS was not significantly associated with higher quartiles of adherence to DRRS. Also, a non-significantly lower prevalence of MetS was observed in the higher quartile of DRRS.ConclusionsAccording to the results of the current study, higher DRRS was associated with lower blood pressure, modified serum lipids, and lower Mets prevalence. Further studies in different populations are warranted for better generalization of the obtained findings.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Eucommia ulmoides (E. ulmoides) leaves are included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and are traditionally used to treat hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. Numerous pharmacological studies have shown that E. ulmoides has a good effect on lowering blood lipids and can improve obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver. Aim: To study the mechanism of E. ulmoides leaves in regulating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by combining prediction and validation. Methods: Using network pharmacology, and molecular docking to predict E. ulmoides in regulating the action mechanism and potential active ingredients of nonalcoholic fatty liver, large hole adsorption resin enrichment active sites, in vitro experiments were performed to verify its fat-lowering effect and mechanism. Results: The major components of E. ulmoides leaves exhibited good combination with lipid metabolismregulating core proteins, particularly flavonoids. EUL 50 significantly reduced lipid accumulation, and increased PPAR gamma. Compared with the control group, the autophagy level increased after the administration of EUL 50. PPAR gamma decreased significantly after the addition of chloroquine (CQ, autophagy inhibitor). Conclusion: The active ingredients in E. ulmoides leaves regulating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are mainly flavonoids and phenolics. EUL 50 may play a role in lowering lipids by regulating PPAR gamma expression through inducing autophagy.

AB Obesity, a chronic metabolic condition, is an increase in fat mass and blood lipid levels mainly causing atherosclerosis and hypertension, which further lead to cardiovascular complications. The objective of the study was to investigate the crude extract of Caralluma edulis (CE.Cr) for its potential against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and its related complications. Hyperlipidemia was induced in Wistar albino rats with HFD (1% cholesterol + 0.5% cholic acid) for 28 days. Treatment groups were administered with different doses of CE.Cr (100, 300 and 500 mg/Kg, p.o.) and the standard group received atorvastatin. At the end of study, sera were analyzed for biochemical markers and the aorta was dissected for microscopic examination. Antioxidant potential was evaluated and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed. The hypotensive potential of CE.Cr was evaluated through an invasive technique. HPLC analysis of CE.Cr showed the presence of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, apigenin and naringenin. Histological examination of the aorta section showed anti-atherosclerotic effects which were also evident from decrease in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins levels. CE.Cr decreased mean arterial blood pressure and evoked significant hypotensive effects. The crude extract of C. edulis showed anti-obesity, antihypertensive, anti-atherosclerotic and antioxidant potential.

AB Background and Purpose 'Food addiction' is the subject of intense public and research interest. However, this nosology based on neurobehavioural similarities among obese individuals, patients with eating disorders and those with substance use disorders (drug addiction) remains controversial. We thus sought to determine which aspects of disordered eating are causally linked to preclinical models of drug addiction. We hypothesized that extensive drug histories, known to cause addiction-like brain changes and drug motivation in rats, would also cause addiction-like food motivation. Experimental Approach Rats underwent extensive cocaine, alcohol, caffeine or obesogenic diet histories and were subsequently tested for punishment-resistant food self-administration or 'compulsive appetite', as a measure of addiction-like food motivation. Key Results Extensive cocaine and alcohol (but not caffeine) histories caused compulsive appetite that persisted long after the last drug exposure. Extensive obesogenic diet histories also caused compulsive appetite, although neither cocaine nor alcohol histories caused excess calorie intake and bodyweight during abstinence. Hence, compulsive appetite and obesity appear to be dissociable, with the former sharing common mechanisms with preclinical drug addiction models. Conclusion and Implications Compulsive appetite, as seen in subsets of obese individuals and patients with binge-eating disorder and bulimia nervosa (eating disorders that do not necessarily result in obesity), appears to epitomize 'food addiction'. Because different drug and obesogenic diet histories caused compulsive appetite, overlapping dysregulations in the reward circuits, which control drug and food motivation independently of energy homeostasis, may offer common therapeutic targets for treating addictive behaviours across drug addiction, eating disorders and obesity.

AB BackgroundMandatory calorie labelling in the out-of-home food sector was introduced in England in 2022, and menu pricing strategies that ensure cost is equivalent to portion size (proportional pricing) have been proposed as a policy to reduce obesity. Food delivery app-based platforms now contribute significantly to diet, and evidence suggests that those at a socioeconomic disadvantage may have greater exposure to unhealthy options on these platforms. However, public health policies to improve nutritional quality of food ordered from food delivery apps has received limited examination.ObjectiveThis experimental study assessed the impact of calorie labelling and proportional pricing on item and meal size selection, calories ordered, and money spent when selecting food and drinks from three outlet types on a virtual delivery app.MethodsUK adult participants (N = 1126, 49% female), stratified by gender and education level completed an online study where they ordered items from three branded food and beverage outlets (coffee shop, sandwich outlet, fast food outlet) using a virtual delivery app. Participants were presented food and beverage options with vs. without calorie labels and with value (larger portions are proportionally cheaper) vs. proportional pricing.ResultsCalorie labelling did not influence portion size selection for any outlets, but significantly reduced calories ordered from the coffee shop (-18.95kcals, 95% CI -33.07 to -4.84) and fast food outlet (-54.19kcals, 95% CI -86.04 to -22.33). Proportional pricing reduced the likelihood of choosing a larger beverage from the coffee shop (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75), but was associated with increased calories ordered from the fast food outlet (51.25kcals, 95% CI 19.59 to 82.90). No consistent interactions were observed with participant characteristics, suggesting that effects of calorie labelling and pricing on outcomes were similar across sociodemographic groups.ConclusionsCalorie labelling on food delivery platforms may effectively reduce calories ordered. Proportional pricing may be useful in prompting consumers to select smaller portion sizes, although further research in real-world settings will now be valuable.

AB ObjectivesMetabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. The current study was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study that aimed to determine the impact of green coffee (GC) in obese patients with metabolic syndrome through analysis of miRNA-155, miRNA-133a and the inflammatory biomarkers such as resistin, TNF-alpha, total sialic acid, homocysteine, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, adiponectin.MethodsOne hundred-sixty obese patients were randomly supplemented either with GC capsules (800 mg) or placebo daily for six months. Both groups were advised to take a balanced diet. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after six months of supplementation.ResultsGC supplementation for 6 months reduced BMI (p = 0.002), waist circumference (p = 0.038), blood glucose (p = 0.002), HbA1c% (p = 0.000), Insulin (p = 0.000), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.005), diastolic BP (p = 0.001) compared with placebo. GC significantly decreased total cholesterol (TC, p = 0.000), LDL-C (p = 0.001), triglycerides (TG, p = 0.002) and increased HDL-C (p = 0.008) compared with placebo group. In addition, GC significantly (p <= 0.005) reduced total sialic acid, homocysteine, resistin, TNF-alpha, hs-CRP and the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased serum adiponectin (p = 0.000) compared to placebo group. There was a significant reduction in the gene expression of miR-133a (p = 0.000) in GC group as compared with baseline levels and with the control placebo group (p = 0.001) after 6 months.ConclusionGC administration modulated metabolic syndrome by decreasing BMI, high BP, blood glucose, dyslipidemia, miRNA-133a and inflammatory biomarkers that constitute risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.ClinicalTrials.gov registration No. is NCT05688917.ConclusionGC administration modulated metabolic syndrome by decreasing BMI, high BP, blood glucose, dyslipidemia, miRNA-133a and inflammatory biomarkers that constitute risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.ClinicalTrials.gov registration No. is NCT05688917.

AB Dietary melanoidins are late stage Maillard reaction products (MRPs), browning colorants and predominantly high molecular weight (HMW) chemicals. They originate through polycondensation reactions of reducing sugars and proteins or amino acids upon thermal processing. Their presence in several daily food and beverages (i.e. coffee, beer, honey, bakery products, chocolate, grilled meat) contribute to food sensory characters (i.e. color, aroma, and flavor). Additionally, melanoidins exhibit many biological attributes (i.e. antioxidant, anti-obesity, antibacterial activity and impact on gut microbiota as prebiotics). However, dissecting melanoidins specific biological and functional characteristics in relation to their metabolism and gut interaction with link to their chemical structures has yet to be reported in literature. For a better understanding of melanoidins benefits and flavor properties in processed foods, this review represents a state of the art comprehensive insight of its formation mechanism and chemistry in relation to their functionalities and health effects. Further, a compile of the factors affecting melanoidins production to optimize for the best flavor attributes while minimizing hazardous compounds is presented. This study presents the first analysis of melanoidins gut interaction in context to its different action mechanisms.

AB Hyperlipidemia is the most well-known cause of metabolic complications and tissue toxicity such as liver steatosis, atherosclerosis and obesity. This study aims to evaluate the preventive effect of loquat fruit peel extract (PE) against tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia and related tissue lipotoxicity in mice. The in vivo study was conducted on mice injected daily with tyloxapol at 100 mg per kg B.W. and treated simultaneously with the PE at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg kg(-1) or fenofibrate for 28 days. Plasma and tissue lipid biochemical analyses were undertaken using enzymatic methods. The antioxidative stress was revealed by measuring the malondialdehyde content and activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase as well as the scavenging activity against lipoperoxyl radicals. The PE significantly prevented oxidative stress and restored lipid metabolism, plasma glucose, body weight, organ relative mass and biomarkers of hepato-nephrotoxicity as well as the histological structure of the liver and kidneys. It contains five major polyphenols, namely, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid and quercetin. According to molecular docking analysis, these compounds and their circulating metabolites could interact with major proteins implicated in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. Overall, the study suggests that PE could prevent hyperlipidemia and related toxic tissue complications.

AB Eucommia ulmoides Oliver (E. ulmoides) is a popular medicinal herb and health supplement in China, Japan, and Korea, and has a variety of pharmaceutical properties. The neuroendocrine-immune (NEI) network is crucial in maintaining homeostasis and physical or psychological functions at a holistic level, consistent with the regulatory theory of natural medicine. This review aims to systematically summarize the chemical compositions, biological roles, and pharmacological properties of E. ulmoides to build a bridge between it and NEI-associated diseases and to provide a perspective for the development of its new clinical applications. After a review of the literature, we found that E. ulmoides has effects on NEI-related diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, insomnia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. However, clinical studies on E. ulmoides were scarce. In addition, E. ulmoides derivatives are diverse in China, and they are mainly used to enhance immunity, improve hepatic damage, strengthen bones, and lower blood pressure. Through network pharmacological analysis, we uncovered the possibility that E. ulmoides is involved in functional interactions with cancer development, insulin resistance, NAFLD, and various inflammatory pathways associated with NEI diseases. Overall, this review suggests that E. ulmoides has a wide range of applications for NEI-related diseases and provides a direction for its future research and development.

AB Evidence suggests that bioactive compounds present in fruits and vegetables, including carotenoids, polyphenols, and phytosterols, may have beneficial effects against the development of obesity and other diseases. The fruits of the Brazilian Cerrado are rich in biologically active compounds but are underexplored by the population being used only locally dietary consumption. The objective of this review is to direct attention to the bioactive compounds already elucidated for the fruits of "Cerrado" cashew (Anacadium othanianum Rizz.), baru almond (Dipteryx alata Vogel), cagaita (Eugenia dysenterica DC.), "Cerrado" pear (Eugenia klotzschiana Berg), mangaba (Hancornia speciosa), and pequi (Caryocar brasiliense Camb), demonstrating possible metabolic effects of the consumption of these fruits on the metabolic syndrome and its risk factors. Studies have shown that Cerrado native fruits have a high content of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds, which also demonstrate high antioxidant capacity and may be related to the protective effect in metabolic syndrome-related diseases by act as inhibitors in various processes in lipid metabolism and glucose transport. Although more scientific evidence is still needed, the consumption of native fruits from the Cerrado seems to be a promising strategy which -along with other strategies such as nutritional therapy- can ameliorate the effects of the metabolic syndrome.

AB Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the leading causes of death globally. There was a 70% increase in diabetes-related deaths between 2000 and 2020, particularly among males. This non-communicable disease is characterized by increased insulin resistance, leading to elevated blood sugar levels and, if untreated, resulting in complications such as nerve damage, kidney disease, blindness, and poor wound healing. T2D management includes dietary intervention, physical exercise, and the administration of blood sugar-lowering medication. However, these medications often have side effects related to intestinal discomfort. Therefore, natural alternatives to standard diabetes medications are being sought to improve the quality of life for individuals with this condition. Polyphenols, which are naturally occurring plant metabolites, have emerged as strong candidates for T2D control. Various phenolic acids (e.g., chlorogenic acid), flavonoids (e.g., quercetin), proanthocyanidins (e.g., procyanidin B2), gallotannins (e.g., monogalloyl hexoside), and ellagitannins (e.g., ellagic acid hexoside) can enhance insulin sensitivity in tissues, reduce chronic inflammation, scavenge free radicals, improve insulin secretion, inhibit enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion, regulate glucose transport across cell membranes, and modulate gut microbiota. This contribution compiles up-to-date evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies on the role of polyphenols in the prevention and management of T2D, emphasizing the mechanisms of action underlying these effects.

AB Obesity and diabetes mellitus are generalized under Diabesity, a concerning epidemic condition that affects mankind diversely. The medicinal flora has been used as a natural remedy for controlling metabolic disorders like diabesity. Dodonaea viscosat (from the Potohar region of Pakistan) has been evaluated as a potential source for the treatment of obesity/diabetes. Different solvent compositions (DVL@100%PEE, DVL@80%HEE, DVL@60%HEE, DVL@40%HEE, DVL@20%HEE & DVL@PAE) were investigated for anti-oxidant, anti-obesity and antidiabetic activities. Among all compositions, DVL@60% HEE ethanolic leaves extract showed highest TFC (89 + 1.94 mgRE/g DE), TPC (144 + 1.37 mgGAE/g DE), DPPH scavenging potential (IC50 = 33.75 + 0.86 mu g/mL), TAP (131.59 +1.30 mg/gAAE), pancreatic lipase inhibition (70.82 + 0.94%) and alpha-glycosidase inhibition (IC50 = 43.52 + 0.80 mu g/mL). Numerous active metabolites have been identified by the highly sensitive UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS analytical technique including Shikimic acid, Cryptomerin B, Menisdaurin, 4-O-Caffeoylquinic acid, Chlorogenic acid, cis-Caffeic acid, Quinic acid, 4-Hydroxymethyl-2-furfural, Epicatechin, Cnidimol F, 3-Hydroxynaringenin, Asaricin, cis-Anethole, E-p-Coumatic acid, Methyl 3-Oferuloylquinate, Lappaol D, Isolariciresinol, and Urolignoside, etc that might be responsible for the substantial anti-obesity/anti diabetic attributes of D. viscosa leaves extracts.

AB Objective: This study aimed to isolate and analyze the components in cedar pine needles (needle leaves of Cedrus deodara (Roxb.) G. Don) that exhibit anti-obesity effects, as determined through animal experiments. Methods: The extract of cedar pine needles was separated into four fractions of different polarities using a macroporous resin column. The fraction that retained anti-obesity activity was evaluated based on the results of animal experiments. Monomeric compounds were structurally characterized and isolated from the active fraction using a preparative liquid chromatography system. Combined with subsequent glucose gel chromatographic separation. The content of the separated components was determined using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS). Results: The water-washed fraction retained anti-obesity activity of the cedar pine needles more effectively. A total of 16 compounds were separated from this fraction, and the contents of 14 of these compounds were determined to be present in cedar pine needles. Conclusion: Nine components, namely p-hydroxy benzyl alcohol, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, P-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, salicylic acid, were characterized and determined for the first time in cedar pine needles. The components with anti-obesity activity in the pine needles of Cedrus are mainly derived from phenolic acids.

AB Star anise (Illicium verum Hook. fil.) is commonly utilized as a culinary and medicinal fruit and is most famous in indigenous systems of medicine. The present research work aims to appraise and validate the potential of polyphenol-rich star anise tea (SAT) on oxidative stress, obesity and related biochemical parameters in high-fat-sugar-diet (HFSD)-induced obesity model in rats. SAT was prepared using the traditional method in warm water. The Reverse Phase High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis was performed for the simultaneous determination of phenolic acids and flavonoids in SAT. Two doses (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) were selected to investigate the anti-obesity potential of SAT using HFSD-induced obese rat model. Major (>5 mg/100 mL) phenolic acids in SAT were p-coumeric acid, gallic aid, cinamic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid while catechin and rutin were the major flavonoids detected in the SAT. SAT exhibited 51.3% DPPH radical scavenging activity. In vivo study showed that higher doses of SAT (500 mg/kg body weight) significantly reduced the body weight increase (74.82%) and BMI (0.64 g/cm(2)). Moreover, significant reductions in the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL and VLDL were recorded in all the treatment groups in comparison to the HFSDC group. Furthermore, SAT reduced the alterations in MDA, SOD and GSH levels of experimental groups thus showing the potential against oxidative stress. The SAT-500 group showed a significant decrease in the elevated kidney and liver weights and atherogenic index in comparison to the HFSDC group. The present study proved that SAT exhibited strong protective effects against obesity and oxidative stress, especially at higher doses.

AB This study undertakes a comprehensive examination of the intricate link between diet nutrition, age, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), utilizing advanced artificial intelligence methodologies. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning from 1999 to 2018 were meticulously analyzed using machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and the proportional hazards model (COX). Using these analytic methods, we elucidated a significant correlation between age and MetS incidence and revealed the impact of age-specific dietary patterns on MetS. The study delineated how the consumption of certain dietary components, namely retinol, beta-cryptoxanthin, vitamin C, theobromine, caffeine, lycopene, and alcohol, variably affects MetS across different age demographics. Furthermore, it was revealed that identical nutritional intakes pose diverse pathogenic risks for MetS across varying age brackets, with substances such as cholesterol, caffeine, and theobromine exhibiting differential risks contingent on age. Importantly, this investigation succeeded in developing a predictive model of high accuracy, distinguishing individuals with MetS from healthy controls, thereby highlighting the potential for precision in dietary interventions and MetS management strategies tailored to specific age groups. These findings underscore the importance of age-specific nutritional guidance and lay the foundation for future research in this area.

AB Cancer, the second leading cause of death worldwide, demands the identification of modifiable risk factors to optimize its prevention. Diet has emerged as a pivotal focus in current research efforts. This literature review aims to enhance the ACS guidelines on diet and cancer by integrating the latest findings and addressing unresolved questions. The methodology involved an advanced PubMed search with specific filters relevant to the research topic. Topics covered include time-restricted diet, diet quality, acid load, counseling, exercise and diet combination, Mediterranean diet, vegetarian and pescetarian diets, weight loss, dairy consumption, coffee and tea, iron, carbohydrates, meat, fruits and vegetables, heavy metals, micronutrients, and phytoestrogens. The review highlights the benefits of the Mediterranean diet in reducing cancer risk. Adherence to overnight fasting or carbohydrate consumption may contribute to cancer prevention, but excessive fasting may harm patients' quality of life. A vegetarian/pescetarian diet is associated with lower risks of general and colorectal cancer compared to a carnivorous diet. High heme and total iron intake are linked to increased lung cancer risk, while phytoestrogen intake is associated with reduced risk. Coffee and tea have a neutral impact on cancer risk. Finally, the roles of several preventive micronutrients and carcinogenic heavy metals are discussed.

AB Sweetpotato (SP, Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam.) is a globally significant food crop known for its high nutritional and functional values. Although the contents and compositions of bioactive constituents vary among SP varieties, sweetpotato by-products (SPBs), including aerial parts, storage root peels, and wastes generated from starch processing, are considered as excellent sources of polyphenols (e.g., chlorogenic acid, caffeoylquinic acid, and dicaffeoylquinic acid), lutein, functional carbohydrates (e.g., pectin, polysaccharides, and resin glycosides) or proteins (e.g., polyphenol oxidase, beta-amylase, and sporamins). This review summarises the health benefits of these ingredients specifically derived from SPBs in vitro and/or in vivo, such as anti-obesity, anti-cancer, antioxidant, cardioprotective, and anti-diabetic, evidencing their potential to regenerate value-added bio-products in the fields of food and nutraceutical. Accordingly, conventional and novel technologies have been developed and sometimes combined for the pretreatment and extraction processes aimed at optimising the recovery efficiency of bioactive ingredients from SPBs while ensuring sustainability. However, so far, advanced extraction technologies have not been extensively applied for recovering bioactive compounds from SPBs except for SP leaves. Furthermore, the incorporation of reclaimed bioactive ingredients from SPBs into foods or other healthcare products remains limited. This review also briefly discusses current challenges faced by the SPB recycling industry while suggesting that more efforts should be made to facilitate the transition from scientific advances to commercialisation for reutilising and valorising SPBs.

AB The flower of Inula britannica contains various phenolic compounds with prophylactic properties. This study aimed to determine the anti-adipogenic effect of an I. britannica flower aqueous extract (IAE) and its underlying mechanisms in the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and to identify the phenolic compounds in the extract. Treatment with IAE inhibited the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by showing a dose-dependently suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation and significantly mitigated expression levels of lipogenesis- and adipogenesis-associated biomarkers including transcription factors. IAE exerted an anti-adipogenic effect through the modulation of the early phases of adipogenesis including mitotic clonal expansion (MCE). Treatment with IAE inhibited MCE by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and suppressing the activation of MCE-related transcription factors. Furthermore, IAE inhibited adipogenesis by regulating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Akt signaling pathways. Protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, and 6-methoxyluteolin, which are reported to exhibit anti-adipogenic properties, were detected in IAE. Therefore, modulation of early phases of adipogenesis, especially MCE, is a key mechanism underlying the anti-adipogenic activity of IAE. In summary, the anti-obesity effects of IAE can be attributed to its phenolic compounds, and hence, IAE can be used for the development of anti-obesity products.

AB BackgroundObesity is one principle risk factor increasing the risk of noncommunicable diseases including diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis. In Thailand, a 2014 study reported obesity (BMI >= 25kg/m(2)) in a Thai population aged >= 15years was 37.5, 32.9 and 41.8% overall and among males and females, respectively. The study aimed to determine trends in the prevalence of obesity among adults residing in a Thai rural community between 2012 and 2018 and investigate the associations between obesity and behavioral factors.MethodsSerial cross-sectional studies were conducted in 2012 and 2018 among adults in Na-Ngam rural community. In 2012 and 2018, all 635 and 627 individuals, respectively, were interviewed using structured questionnaires related to demographics, risk behaviors, comorbidities and arthrometric measurement. Spot urine was collected by participants and obesity was defined as BMI >= 25kg/m(2). The risk factors for obesity were analyzed in the 2018 survey.ResultsA total of 1262 adults in Na-Ngam rural community were included in the study. The prevalence of obesity was 33.9% in 2012 and 44.8% in 2018 (P <0.001). The average BMI increased from 23.94.2kg/m(2) in 2012 to 25.0<plus/minus>4.52kg/m(2) in 2018 (P <0.001). Obesity was associated with higher age (AOR 0.99; 95%CI 0.97-0.99), smoking (AOR 0.52; 95%CI 0.28-0.94), instant coffee-mix consumption >1 cup/week (AOR 1.44; 95%CI 1.02-2.04), higher number of chronic diseases (>= 1 disease AOR 1.82; 95%CI 1.01-2.68, >2 diseases AOR 2.15; 95%CI 1.32-3.50), and higher spot urine sodium level (AOR 1.002; 95%CI 0.99-1.01).Conclusion p id=Par Our data emphasized that obesity constituted a serious problem among adults residing in a rural community. A trend in significant increase was found regarding the prevalence of obesity and average BMI in the rural community over 6years. Effective public health interventions should be provided at the community level to reduce BMI. Moreover, modifiable risk factors for obesity should be attenuated to inhibit the progression of metabolic syndrome, noncommunicable diseases and their complications.

AB Background and Objectives: While the health promoting effects of green tea polyphenols have been identified among adult, research on children is scarce probably due to safety concerns about caffeine. This study aims to evaluate the safety of decaffeinated green tea polyphenols (DGTP) supplementation in girls with obesity and lay the foundation for its application in children population. Methods and Study Design: This 12 -week randomized, double -blinded, parallel -controlled trial was performed among 62 girls with obesity aged 6 to 10 years old. Participants were allocated to take 400 mg/d DGTP (DGTP group, n = 31) or isodose placebo (Control group, n = 31) at random. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical parameters including hepatic and renal function indicators, serum minerals concentrations, and routine blood parameters, were measured at baseline and the end of this trial. DGTP intake diary was required for each participant to record any abnormal reactions. Results: After the 12 -week supplementation, compared to Control group, the uric acid concentration in DGTP group showed a significant decrease (-48.0 +/- 83.2 vs -0.01 +/- 69.1, mu mol/L), within the normal range. Regarding other biochemical indicators, there were no significant differences in changed values between the two groups. Throughout the trial, no adverse effects were reported in either group. Conclusions: This study indicated that the supplementation of 400 mg/d DGTP for 12 weeks had no adverse health effects in girls with obesity, providing evidence for the DGTP adoption in children research.

AB Background: Currently, obesity is a global health challenge due to its increasing prevalence and associated health risk. It is associated with various metabolic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, certain forms of cancer, and non-alcoholic liver diseases (NAFLD). Objective: The aim of this study to evaluate the effects of polyphenol enriched herbal complex (Rubus crataegifolius/ellagic acid, Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge/vitexin, chlorogenic acid, Cinnamomum cassiaa/cinnamic acid) on obesity and obesity induced NAFLD in the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. Methods: Obesity was induced in male C57BL/6 mice using HFD. After 8 weeks, the mice were treated with HFD+ plants extract for 8 weeks. Body weight, food intake weekly, and blood sugar level were measured. After sacrifice, changes in the treated group's liver weight, fat weight, serum biochemical parameters, hormone levels, and enzyme levels were measured. For histological analysis, tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Oil Red-O. Results: Our results showed that the herbal complex ameliorated body weight and liver weight gain, and decreased total body fat in HFD-fed animals. Post prandial blood glucose (PBG) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were lower in the herbal complex-treated group than in the HFD control group. Additionally, herbal formulation treatment significantly increased HDL levels in serum and decreased TC, TG, AST, ALT, deposition of fat droplets in the liver, and intima media thickness (IMT) in the aorta. Herbal complex increased serum adiponectin and decreased serum leptin. Herbal complex also increased carnitine palmityl transferase (CPT) activity and significantly decreased enzyme activity of beta-hydroxy beta methyl glutamyl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated that the herbal complex is an effective herbal formulation in the attenuation of obesity and obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction including NAFLD in HFD-induced mouse model.

AB Sugar intake may increase the risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and dental caries. In Taiwan, people frequently consume sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). This study explored the energy and sugar content of Taiwanese SSBs and evaluated them using the Chilean warning label system (>70 kcal/100 mL and >5 g sugar/100 mL) and the World Health Organization (WHO) sugar guideline (<= 25 g sugar). A total of 341 SSBs with volumes <= 600 mL were analyzed. No significant differences were observed in sugar per serving among different types of SSBs, but a great variation in portion size (i.e., package size for individual consumption) was noted. The energy and sugar ratios per serving were lower in soft drinks and coffee and tea containing >1 serving than in those containing only one serving. The calorie and sugar ratios per portion were higher in all types of SSBs containing >1 serving per portion than in those containing exactly one serving. Approximately 70.0% of Taiwanese SSBs were classified as high sugar according to the Chilean criteria, and 41.6% of SSBs exceeded the WHO guideline. Moreover, 40.8% of SSBs that were not considered as high sugar according to the Chilean criteria contained >25 g sugar per portion. For individual consumption, it is more clear that nutrition labeling is based on portion rather than serving. Evaluating SSBs on sugar/portion rather than sugar/100 mL will help consumers make better choices.

AB Aster scaber is a wild vegetable cultivated in Korea and is known to contain phytochemicals with various biological activities. The potential antioxidant and anti-obesity effects of A. scaber and their mechanism are yet to be reported. We evaluated the total phenolic, flavonoid, and proanthocyanidin contents and oxygen radical absorbance capacity of A. scaber ethanolic extract (ASE), and analyzed the major phenolic compounds of ASE. Antioxidant activity was measured at the chemical level through 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), reducing power assay, 2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay. In addition, it was measured in vitro through inhibition of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in 3T3-L1 adipocyte, and inhibition of lipid accumulation was also evaluated. ASE reduced the expression of enzymes involved in the production of ROS and increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes that reduce increased ROS levels. They also reduced the expression of adipogenesis transcription factors that regulate adipocyte differentiation in relation to ROS production, inhibited the expression of lipogenesis-related genes related to fat accumulation through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, and increased expression of lipolysis-related genes. Thus, ASE containing CGA (chlorogenic acid) inhibits ROS production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, owing to its strong antioxidant activity, and inhibits lipid accumulation caused by oxidative stress. The extract can be used as a potential functional food material for reducing oxidative stress and obesity.

ID RETAIL-PRICES; BERKELEY; FOOD
AB Seattle's Sweetened Beverage Tax is an excise tax of 1.75 cents per ounce on sugar-sweetened beverages and is one of the highest beverage taxes in the U.S. This study examined the impact of Seattle's tax on the prices of beverages. We conducted audits of 407 retail food stores and eating places (quick service restaurants and coffee shops) before and 6 months after the tax was implemented in Seattle and in a comparison area. Ordinary least squares difference-in-differences models with store fixed effects were used to estimate the effect of the tax on prices, stratified by beverage type and store type. In secondary analyses, we assessed the effect of the tax on the price of non-taxed beverages and foods. Results from the adjusted difference-in-differences models indicated the tax was associated with an average increase of 1.58 cents per ounce among Seattle retailers, representing 90 % of the price of the tax. By store type, price increases were highest in smaller grocery stores and drug stores. By beverage type, price increases were highest for energy beverages and soda and lowest for bottled coffee and juice drinks. Prices of some nontaxed beverages also increased while the prices of select healthy foods generally did not. The sweetened beverage tax in Seattle is higher than beverage taxes in most other cities, and nearly the full cost of the tax is being passed through to consumers for many beverage types and stores types.

AB Polyphenols from Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) alleviate obesity-related metabolic complications but the metabolites responsible for such effects are unknown. We aimed to elucidate which of the potential plasma metabolites from a polyphenol-enriched HS (PEHS) extract contributed for the reversion of glucolipotoxicity-induced metabolic stress using 3T3-L1 adipocyte and INS 832/13 pancreatic beta-cell models under glucolipotoxic conditions.
   PEHS extract, quercetin (Q) and quercetin-3-O-glucuronide (Q3GA) showed stronger capacity to decrease glucolipotoxicity-induced ROS generation than ascorbic acid or chlorogenic acid. PEHS extract, Q and Q3GA decreased secretion of cytokines (leptin, THE-alpha, IGF-1, IL-6, VEGF, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and CCL2) and reduced CCL2 expression at transcriptional level. In addition, PEHS extract, Q and Q3GA reduced triglyceride accumulation, which occurred through fatty acid synthase (FASN) downregulation, AMPK activation and mitochondrial mass and biogenesis restoration via PPAR alpha upregulation. Electron microscopy confirmed that PEHS extract and Q3GA decreased mitochondrial remodeling and mitophagy. Virtual screening leads us to postulate that Q and Q3GA might act as agonists of these protein targets at specific sites.
   These data suggest that Q and Q3GA may be the main responsible compounds for the capacity of PEHS extract to revert glucolipotoxicity-induced metabolic stress through AMPK-mediated decrease in fat storage and increase in fatty acid oxidation, though other compounds of the extract may contribute to this capacity.

AB In this study, the anti-adipogenic activities of compounds isolated from Solidago viraurea var. gigantea (SG) extracts were investigated using Oil Red O staining in the 3T3-L1 cell line. Four known compounds including 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5), protocatechuic acid (6), chlorogenic acid (7), and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (8), and four undescribed compounds including (1R,2S,3S,5R,7S)-methyl 7-((cinnamoyloxy)methyl)-2,3-dihydroxy-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]-octane-5-carboxylate (1), (1R,2S,3S,5R,7S)-methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-7-((((Z)-3-phenylacryloyl)oxy)methyl)-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]-octane-5-carboxylate (2), (1R,2S,3S,5R,7S)-2,3-dihydroxy-7((((Z)-3-phenylacryloyl)oxy)methyl)-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]-octane-5-carboxylic acid (3), and (1R,2S,3S,5R,7S)7-((cinnamoyloxy)methyl)-2,3-dihydroxy-6,8-dioxabicyclo-[3.2.1]-octane-5-carboxylic acid (4) were isolated from S. viraurea var. gigantea. The structures of the compounds were first identified by comparing their H-1 NMR spectra with spectral data from the literature and a more detailed identification was then performed using 2D NMR (Correlated spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC), heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC), and nuclear overhauser spectroscopy (NOESY)), and X-ray crystallography analyses. The anti-adipogenic activities of all compounds were evaluated by MTT assay and Oil Red O staining in 3T3-L1 cells. 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid was found to inhibit lipid accumulation more potently than the other tested compounds.

AB Background The spices based dietary interventions are in lime light among the scientific community owing to their promising therapeutic perspective. The bioactive components in spices can be used to exert various health promoting functions in human body such as prompting weight loss, inhibit diet-induced obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, allergies and various other maladies. In current study extraction and in vitro characterization of coriander seed (CS), black cumin seed (BCS) and fenugreek seed (FS) polyphenols was conducted for further development of dietary intervention against lipid and glycemia related abnormalities in experimental Sprague Dowley rats fed with control and different spice powder supplemented diets. Methods Purposely, extraction of Coriander (CS), Black cumin (BCS) and Fenugreek seeds (FS) were carried out by using water and aqueous methanol (70:30 v/v). Afterwards, the resultant extracts were thoroughly investigated for their antioxidant potential through different indices like TPC, TFC, FRAP and beta Carotene Bleaching Assay and ABTS. Furthermore, HPLC quantification were also conducted with special reference to thymoquinone, disogenin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and kaempferol alongside in vitro pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity estimation. Bio-evaluation trial was consisting of three modules i.e. study-I (normal diet), study-II (high cholesterol diet) and study-III (high sucrose diet). Furthermore, rats were sub-divided in five groups in each module on the basis of diet provision including T-0 (control), T-1 (Diet containing CS), T-2 (Diet containing BCS), T-3 (Diet containing FS) and T-4 (Diet containing CSP + BCSP + FSP). At the beginning of trial, some rats were dissected to evaluate the baseline values whilst rest of the rats was killed at the termination (56th day). Feed and drink intakes were quantified on daily bases whereas, body weight was calculated weekly. Cholesterol level, serum low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), triglycerides, glucose concentration and insulin level of collected sera was measured by standard procedures. Results The in vitro characterization showed better extraction of spices antioxidant through aqueous methanol as compared to water. Among the spices, Black cumin seed alone or in combination revealed highest antioxidant activity in T2 (BCS) followed by T4 (CS + BCS), T7 (CS + BCS + FS), T1 (CS), T6 (BCS + FS), T5 (CS + FS) and lowest in T3 (FS). Likewise, the HPLC characterization showed the presence of thymoquinone in BCS, Dosignienin FGS and chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and kaempferol in the other treatments. Furthermore, all the treatments showed dose dependent inhibition in Pancreatic lipase activity and order of inhibition was BCS > CS + BCS > CS + BCS + FS > CS > BCS + FC > CS + FS > FS. The maximum feed intake, drink intake and weight gain was observed in T0 (control) trailed by T1, T2, T3 and T4 group in experimental study I, II and III, respectively. The resultant diet T4 enhanced the high density lipoprotein from T0 (58.58 +/- 2.51) to 61.71 +/- 1.62 (T4) in hypercholesterolemia rats whereas in hyperglycaemia rats the HDL was varied from 38.77 +/- 1.2 to 40.02 +/- 0.99 in T0 and T4, respectively. Similarly, T2 significantly lowered the low density lipoprotein from 62.53 +/- 1.22 (T1) & 46.53 +/- 0.99 to 54.88 +/- 0.52 & 40.94 +/- 1.99 (T2) in hypercholesteraemic and diabetic rats.
   Moreover, T4 treatment showed maximum reduction as 10.01 & 11.53% in respective studies.
   Conclusions The diet prepared from the different combination of spices has been proven effective against Oxidative stress related physiological malfunctioning.

AB In the middle of an ever-changing landscape of diabetes care, precision medicine, and lifestyle therapies are becoming increasingly important. Dietary polyphenols are like hidden allies found in our everyday meals. These biomolecules, found commonly in fruits, vegetables, and various plant-based sources, hold revolutionary potential within their molecular structure in the way we approach diabetes and its intimidating consequences. There are currently numerous types of diabetes medications, but they are not appropriate for all patients due to limitations in dosages, side effects, drug resistance, a lack of efficacy, and ethnicity. Currently, there has been increased interest in practicing herbal remedies to manage diabetes and its related complications. This article aims to summarize the potential of dietary polyphenols as a foundation in the treatment of diabetes and its associated consequences. We found that most polyphenols inhibit enzymes linked to diabetes. This review outlines the potential benefits of selected molecules, including kaempferol, catechins, rosmarinic acid, apigenin, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid, in managing diabetes mellitus as these compounds have exhibited promising results in in vitro, in vivo, in silico, and some preclinical trials study. This encompassing exploration reveals the multifaceted impact of polyphenols not only in mitigating diabetes but also in addressing associated conditions like inflammation, obesity, and even cancer. Their mechanisms involve antioxidant functions, immune modulation, and proinflammatory enzyme regulation. Furthermore, these molecules exhibit anti-tumor activities, influence cellular pathways, and activate AMPK pathways, offering a less toxic, cost-effective, and sustainable approach to addressing diabetes and its complications.

AB Background-Medicinal plants are traditionally used as infusions or decoctions for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic and anti-diabetic properties. Purpose-The aim of the study was to define the polyphenol composition and to assess the antioxidant capacity of eight medicinal plants from Reunion Island referred to in the French Pharmacopeia, namely Aphloia theiformis, Ayapana triplinervis, Dodonaea viscosa, Hubertia ambavilla, Hypericum lanceolatum, Pelargonium x graveolens, Psiloxylon mauritianum and Syzygium cumini. Methods-Polyphenol content was assessed by biochemical assay and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by measuring DPPH reduction and studying the protective effects of herbal preparation on red blood cells or preadipocytes exposed to oxidative stress. Results-Polyphenol content ranged from 25 to 143 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/L for infusions and 35 to 205 mg GAE/L for decoctions. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analysis showed the presence of major bioactive polyphenols, such as quercetin, chlorogenic acid, procyanidin and mangiferin. Antioxidant capacity assessed by different tests, including DPPH and Human red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis of herbal preparations, demonstrated a dose-dependent effect whatever the extraction procedure. Our data suggest that decoction slightly improved polyphenol extraction as well as antioxidant capacity relative to the infusion mode of extraction (DPPH test). However, infusions displayed a better protective effect against oxidative stress-induced RBC hemolysis. Conclusion-Traditional preparations of medicinal plant aqueous extracts (infusions and decoctions) display antioxidant properties that limit oxidative stress in preadipocytes and red blood cells, supporting their use in the context of metabolic disease prevention and treatment.

AB Oxidative stress is involved in the metabolic dysregulation of type 2 diabetes (DM2). Acrocomia aculeata (Aa) fruit pulp has been described for the treatment of several diseases, and recently we have proved that its leaves have phenolic compounds with a marked antioxidant effect. We aimed to assess whether they can improve metabolic, redox and vascular functions in DM2. Control Wistar (W-Ctrl) and non-obese type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK-Ctrl) rats were treated for 30 days with 200 mg.kg(-1) aqueous extract of Aa (EA-Aa) (Wistar, W-EA-Aa/GK, GK-EA-Aa). EA-Aa was able to reduce fasting glycaemia and triglycerides of GK-EA-Aa by improving proteins related to glucose and lipid metabolism, such as GLUT-4, PPAR gamma, AMPK, and IR, when compared to GK-Ctrl. It also improved viability of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes exposed by H2O2. EA-Aa also increased the levels of catalase in the aorta and kidney, reduced oxidative stress and increased relaxation of the aorta in GK-treated rats in relation to GK-Ctrl, in addition to the protective effect against oxidative stress in HMVec-D cells. We proved the direct antioxidant potential of the chemical compounds of EA-Aa, the increase in antioxidant defences in a tissue-specific manner and hypoglycaemic properties, improving vascular function in type 2 diabetes. EA-Aa and its constituents may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of DM2 complications.

AB Objectives: Nutritional factors are amongst the major determinants in the onset and development of obesity and metabolic complications. Nevertheless, the dietary determinants of metabolic health are not completely elucidated. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate nutritional and dietary factors that may contribute to metabolic heterogeneity in individuals with obesity or normal weight. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and google scholar databases until August 2021, to locate studies that examined metabolic health and its association with intakes of specific foods or food groups, nutrient intakes or status, as well as adherence to certain dietary patterns. Two researchers had independently screened titles and abstracts, examined full-text studies, conducted data extraction, and evaluated their quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: Twenty-seven studies, with a total of 39518 subjects, were included. Of these studies, 11 articles evaluated the association between different dietary patterns and metabolic phenotypes, while 15 had investigated the association of single food/nutrients intakes or nutrient status with metabolic phenotype, and one paper evaluated the association of dietary inflammatory index with metabolic health. The findings of these studies propose that healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean pattern, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, and population-derived patterns (such as the "Healthy" and "Fruit and vegetable" patterns) were associated with higher odds of the metabolically healthy phenotype. Higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, coffee/tea, vitamin D, magnesium, and flavonoids, were suggested to lower the risk of developing metabolically unhealthy phenotype, while, higher consumption of saturated fat, carbohydrate and sugar-sweetened beverages, fast foods, organ meats, and a pro-inflammatory diet increased the risk. Conclusion: Results from published studies, which were mostly cross-sectional, suggest that higher adherence to unhealthier dietary patterns, characterized by the consumption of refined and processed foods, was associated with a lower likelihood of having a healthy metabolic phenotype, while the opposite was observed for healthier dietary patterns. Findings may be used in developing nutritional strategies aimed at improving metabolic health in the population.

AB Healthy eating behaviour of women is critical not only for their health but also for their children's health and well-being. The present study examined the dietary pattern, nutrition-related knowledge, and attitudes of working women in Western Province, Sri Lanka. In addition, this study identified the factors associated with dietary diversity score (DDS). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 working women, aged 20-60 years, in Western Province, Sri Lanka. The data on socio-demography, dietary patterns, and nutrition-related knowledge and attitudes were collected. Overall, 38% of the women were overweight and 13% were obese. The median frequency of intake of chicken, fish, eggs, milk and milk products, green leafy vegetables, and fruits were 2, 5, 2, 9, 5, and 10 respectively, per week. A large majority of the women (70%) had tea/coffee with sugar and snacks (60%) at least four times a week. Only a third of the women met the minimum DDS, while more than half of the women had good nutrition-related knowledge and attitudes. Women with good nutrition-related knowledge were more frequent consumers of roots/tubers, shellfish, vegetables, fruit, fruit juice, nuts and oils, and fast food. Women with good nutrition-related attitudes had a significantly lower frequency of consumption of soya meat, while having a higher frequency of consumption of fast food. Multiple regression analysis showed that age and household income were significantly independently related to DDS, while attitudes were negatively associated. While there was a trend, the association of nutrition-related knowledge with DDS was not statistically significant (p = 0.057). The overall F ratio (8.46) was highly significant (p = 0.001) and the adjusted R-2 was 0.093. The results demonstrate that a significant proportion of working women have good basic nutrition-related knowledge and attitudes, while two-thirds of them do not meet the minimum DDS. Furthermore, age, family income, and knowledge were positively associated with DDS, while attitudes were negatively associated. Before designing any intervention, further research is needed using a qualitative approach to understand how nutrition knowledge and eating behaviour are related in this population group.

AB Approximately 80% of the major chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, hyper-tension, and diet-related cancers, are at least partly preventable with better nutrition. Unfortunately, medical training and practice is focused on the treatment of these con-ditions after their diagnosis. It is critically important that both the clinician and the pa-tient understand that humans are required to consume a varied diet that contains sufficient liquids and the essential vitamins, mineral, fats, and amino acids necessary for life. General fluency with respect to the health effects of water, tea, coffee, SSBs is also an area of intense patient interest and clinical significance. An improved under-standing of the governmental organizations responsible for nutrition recommenda-tions and the use of NFLs on food products can improve health outcomes. Growth charts, BMI, and caloric need calculations are also important clinical nutrition consid-erations. Finally, the complications to food availability, delivery, and nutrition assess-ment in relation to the ongoing COVID pandemic will continue to stress our ability to provide the most data-driven recommendations concerning nutrition for health, dis-ease prevention, and treatment. It is clear that much needs to be done to avoid a continuation of the increase in deaths associated with many different diet-based pre-ventable conditions. It is true that the scientific basis of nutrition recommendations is constantly changing, as is true for all science/research-based fields. This article can help the clinician understand the changes that have led to the current diet recommen-dations and can remind the patient that as more nutrition research is done, the recom-mendations will further improve their nutrition and overall health.

AB Tea is prepared from the young leaves, buds, stalks of the plant Camellia sinensis. The cultivation process of tea plants and the habit of tea drinking were initiated in China from ancient times. Now, the consumption of tea is very popular throughout the world and it is an integral part of our social culture. Tea contains polyphenolic compounds (catechins and epicatechins), theaflavins, flavonol glycosides, L-theanine, caffeine, theobromine, and volatile organic substances. These bioactive components are responsible for the astringency, flavor, aroma, and taste of the tea as well as its health beneficial effects. Moreover, tea has several medicinal values. The phytochemical components are involved in the prevention and cure of many illnesses like cardiovascular diseases, malignancy, digestive dysfunction, and metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes. Tea flavonoids show strong antioxidant properties. Caffeine and other methylxanthine regulate the intracellular second messenger levels. Additionally, catechins exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. All these multidimensional actions make some positive attributes in favor of neuroprotection, cardioprotection, and cancer prevention. Various approaches are also taken to use tea ingredients as an adjuvant in cancer therapy. This review emphasizes the importance of bioactive components, and their health promotional activities.

AB Theanine, polyphenols, and caffeine not only affect the flavor of tea, but also play an important role in human health benefits. However, the specific regulatory mechanism of Se NMs on fat-reducing components is still unclear. In this study, the synthesis of fat-reducing components in Fuding Dabai (FDDB) tea was investigated. The results indicated that the 100-bud weight, theanine, EGCG, total catechin, and caffeine contents of tea buds were optimally promoted by 10 mg<middle dot>L-1 Se NMs in the range of 24.3%, 36.2%, 53.9%, 67.1%, and 30.9%, respectively. Mechanically, Se NMs promoted photosynthesis in tea plants, increased the soluble sugar content in tea leaves (30.3%), and provided energy for the metabolic processes, including the TCA cycle, pyruvate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and the glutamine/glutamic acid cycle, ultimately increasing the content of amino acids and antioxidant substances (catechins) in tea buds; the relative expressions of key genes for catechin synthesis, CsPAL, CsC4H, CsCHI, CsDFR, CsANS, CsANR, CsLAR, and UGGT, were significantly upregulated by 45.1-619.1%. The expressions of theanine synthesis genes CsTs, CsGs, and CsGOGAT were upregulated by 138.8-693.7%. Moreover, Se NMs promoted more sucrose transfer to the roots, with the upregulations of CsSUT1, CsSUT2, CsSUT3, and CsSWEET1a by 125.8-560.5%. Correspondingly, Se NMs enriched the beneficial rhizosphere microbiota (Roseiarcus, Acidothermus, Acidibacter, Conexicter, and Pedosphaeraceae), enhancing the absorption and utilization of ammonium nitrogen by tea plants, contributing to the accumulation of theanine. This study provides compelling evidence supporting the application of Se NMs in promoting the lipid-reducing components of tea by enhancing its nitrogen metabolism.

AB The exponential increase of metabolic syndrome and its association with the risk impact of morbidity and mortality has propitiated the development of tools to diagnose this syndrome early. This work presents a model that is based on prognostic variables to classify Mexicans with metabolic syndrome without blood screening applying machine and deep learning. The data that were used in this study contain health parameters related to anthropometric measurements, dietary information, smoking habit, alcohol consumption, quality of sleep, and physical activity from 2289 participants of the Mexico City Tlalpan 2020 cohort. We use accuracy, balanced accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value criteria to evaluate the performance and validate different models. The models were separated by gender due to the shared features and different habits. Finally, the highest performance model in women found that the most relevant features were: waist circumference, age, body mass index, waist to height ratio, height, sleepy manner that is associated with snoring, dietary habits related with coffee, cola soda, whole milk, and Oaxaca cheese and diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Men's features were similar to women's; the variations were in dietary habits, especially in relation to coffee, cola soda, flavored sweetened water, and corn tortilla consumption. The positive predictive value obtained was 84.7% for women and 92.29% for men. With these models, we offer a tool that supports Mexicans to prevent metabolic syndrome by gender; it also lays the foundation for monitoring the patient and recommending change habits.

AB Low-grade chronic inflammation and adipocyte dysfunction are prominent risk factors of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in obesity. Thus, prevention of inflammation and adipocyte dysfunction could be one possible approach to mitigate T2DM development. Several Ficus species have been used in traditional medicine for ameliorating inflammation and T2DM. Our previous studies reported biological effects of Ficus lindsayana including antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-alpha-glucosidase activities. Further, this study therefore investigated whether F. lindsayana latex (FLLE) and root (FLRE) extracts inhibit inflammation-stimulated insulin resistance in adipocytes and inflammation in macrophages. FLLE and FLRE (200 mu g/mL) had no significant cytotoxicity for macrophages, adipocytes, and blood cells (PBMCs and RBCs). FLRE had a total flavonoid content about three times higher than FLLE, while both had similar levels of total phenolic content. FLRE showed higher abilities than FLLE in suppressing inflammation in both macrophages and adipocytes and reversing the inflammation-induced insulin resistance in adipocytes. In TNF-alpha-induced adipocytes, FLRE significantly improved insulin-induced glucose uptake and insulin-suppressed lipolysis, while FLLE only significantly improved glucose uptake. Moreover, FLRE and FLLE remarkably reduced chemoattractant (MCP-1) but improved adipogenic (PPAR gamma and CEBP alpha) gene expression, leading to the promotion of adipogenesis and the suppression of insulin resistance. In LPS-induced macrophages, FLRE, but not FLLE, significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO production. Moreover, FLRE significantly reduced LPS-stimulated iNOS, COX-2, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha gene expression. These results may provide the potential data for the development of this plant, especially the root part, as an alternative medicine, functional ingredient, or food supplement for the prevention of inflammation and obesity-associated insulin resistance, as well as T2DM.

AB The inhibition of certain digestive enzymes by target food matrices represents a new approach in the treatment of socially significant diseases. Proving the ability of fruits to inhibit such enzymes can support the inclusion of specific varieties in the daily diets of patients with diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, etc., providing them with much more than just valuable micro- and macromolecules. The current study aimed atidentifying and comparing the GC-MS metabolic profiles of eight peach varieties ("Filina", "Ufo 4, "Gergana", "Laskava", "July Lady", "Flat Queen", "Evmolpiya", and "Morsiani 90") grown in Bulgaria (local and introduced) and to evaluate the inhibitory potential of their extracts towards alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, lipase, and acetylcholinesterase. In order to confirm samples' differences or similarities, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were also applied to the identified metabolites. The results provide important insights into the metabolomic profiles of the eight peach varieties and represent a first attempt to characterize the peels of the peach varieties with respect to alpha-glucosidase-, alpha-amylase-, lipase-, and acetylcholinesterase-inhibitory activities. All of the studied peach extracts displayed inhibitory activity towards alpha-glucosidase (IC50: 125-757 mg/mL) and acetylcholinesterase (IC50: 60-739 mg/mL), but none of them affected alpha-amylase activity. Five of the eight varieties showed inhibitory activity towards porcine pancreatic lipase (IC50: 24-167 mg/mL). The obtained results validate the usefulness of peaches and nectarines as valuable sources of natural agents beneficial for human health, although further detailed investigation should be performed in order to thoroughly identify the enzyme inhibitors responsible for each activity.

AB Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic condition associated with obesity, oxidative stress-mediated inflammation, apoptosis, and impaired insulin signaling. The utilization of phytochemical therapy generated from plants has emerged as a promising approach for the treatment of diabetes and its complications. Kiwifruit is recognized for its substantial content of antioxidative phenolics. Therefore, this work aimed to examine the effect of Actinidia deliciosa (kiwi fruit) on hepatorenal damage in a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2D in rats using in vivo and in silico analyses. An increase in hepatic and renal lipid peroxidation was observed in diabetic rats accompanied by a decrease in antioxidant status. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that there were observable inflammatory and apoptotic responses in the hepatic and renal organs of rats with diabetes, along with a dysregulation of the phosphorylation levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), protein kinase B (Akt), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling proteins. However, the administration of kiwi extract to diabetic rats alleviated hepatorenal dysfunction, inflammatory processes, oxidative injury, and apoptotic events with activation of the insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies revealed quercetin, chlorogenic acid, and melezitose as components of kiwi extract that docked well with potential as effective natural products for activating the silent information regulator 1(SIRT-1) pathway. Furthermore, phenolic acids in kiwi extract, especially syringic acid, P-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid, have the ability to inhibit the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) active site. In conclusion, it can be argued that kiwi extract may present a potentially beneficial adjunctive therapy approach for the treatment of diabetic hepatorenal complications.

AB Excess sugary drink (SD) consumption is associated with childhood obesity and development of cardiometabolic disease. In addition to having high added sugar content, many SDs also contain caffeine, which may further encourage excess SD consumption among children. The objective of this study was to develop a conceptual framework of children's caffeinated SD consumption using group concept mapping, an applied social research multimethodology that collectively harnesses qualitative and quantitative data from participants to generate a visual representation of their ideas and input. Children, 8-14 years old, who reported consuming >= 12 ounces of caffeinated SDs (e.g., sodas, sweet teas) per day were recruited throughout Washington, D.C. and invited to participate. Concept mapping included three participant-driven activities: (1) brainstorming (n = 51), during which children reported reasons for their SD consumption, from which 58 unique reasons were identified; (2) sorting (n = 70), during which children sorted each of the reported reasons into categories and named each category; and (3) rating (n = 74), during which children rated the influence of each reason on their own caffeinated SD consumption. Similarity matrices, multidimensional scaling, and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to generate concept maps (hereafter "SODA MAPS"), which display the 58 reasons organized within eight overarching clusters. Among these eight clusters, Taste and Feel, Something to Do, and Energy were rated as particularly influential. Children's caffeinated SD consumption is encouraged not only by the palatable taste and reported preferences for these beverages (e.g., Taste and Feel), but also by psychological (e.g., Mood and Focus), biological (e.g., Energy), social (e.g., Something to Do) and environmental reasons (e.g., Nothing Better Available). Thus, the SODA MAPS can inform the development of tailored, multi-level SD reduction interventions that incorporate strategies to address important and currently overlooked reasons for caffeinated SD consumption among children.

AB Obesity is an increasingly severe global health problem, leading to chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Matcha is a powdered green tea, and it is very popular in recent years as a beverage and food additive. Matcha green tea has been reported to have outstanding potential in regulating obesity-related metabolic syndrome. However, there are few studies on the regulation mechanism of matcha green tea on the central nervous system. In this study, we established a high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model. The results showed that dietary supplementation with matcha could effectively inhibit the weight gain, fat accumulation, glycemia and lipidemia increase, and excessive activation of microglia in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Furthermore, we used different concentrations (100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20%, v/v) of ethanol solution to prepare matcha ethanol extracts, and investigated their effects on palmitic acid-induced inflammation of microglial BV-2 cells. The results showed that matcha ethanol extracts could significantly reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines and the expression and phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3.

AB The study aims to describe the consumption of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages according to sociodemographic, health and location variables. Cross-sectional study with ELSA-Brasil data (2008-2010). A questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic, food, health data and anthropometry. Descriptive analysis and association with variables of interest were carried out. In the sample, 8% of the total caloric value comes from non-alcoholic beverages (5.6%: sugary drinks), and 4% from alcoholic beverages (2.7%: beer). Consumers of unsweetened and artificially sweetened beverages reported moderate/strong physical activity, former smokers and higher education. The opposite was true for sugary drinks. Eutrophic people reported higher consumption of sugary drinks and those obese, artificially sweetened and beer. Alcohol consumption varied with age (young: beer; elderly: wine/spirits) and education (low education: beer/spirits; higher education: wine). Coffee, natural juice and soda were the most consumed non-alcoholic beverages and beer was the most prevalent alcoholic beverage. Consumption variation was observed according to geographic location. The consumption of sugary and alcoholic beverages is high in Brazil and public health strategies are required.

AB Background: Consumption of caffeinated energy drinks (CED) has escalated during the last few years, especially among schoolchildren, with evident adverse health sequelae in this critical age group.
   Objective: This study examined the prevalence of CED consumption and its associations with sleep, physical and mental health, and dietary and lifestyle habits among schoolchildren in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
   Method: A structured self-administered online questionnaire was developed and disseminated among schoolchildren aged 14-18 years, selected from schools of the seven emirates of the UAE.
   Results: More than 4,500 (N= 4,648) responses received. A relatively low prevalence of CED consumption (20%) was found among schoolchildren in the UAE. However, those who reported CED consumption were more likely to report unhealthy dietary (skipping breakfast, frequent snacking, and eating fast foods, low fruit, and vegetable intake) and lifestyle behaviors (long screen time, poor sleep health), in addition to poor self-reported mental and physical health than non-users. CED consumption was significantly and variably associated with multiple sociodemographic factors such as students' nationality, parental companionship, sex, school type, education level (children's and parents'), daily allowance, academic performance, screen time, sleep quality parameters, self-reported physical and mental health, and parents' employment. Sources of knowledge about CED were social media (55%), friends/ schoolmates (52%), and family members (52%). Students believed that CED constitute sugar (87%), caffeine (69%), artificial flavors (67%) sweeteners (54%), and stimulating components (43%). The majority (70%) of students reported that CED consumption increases the risks for heart disease, diabetes, high blood sugar (65%), addiction (64%), high blood pressure (59%), and obesity (57%).
   Conclusion: These results offer important insights for health professionals, child health specialists, policymakers, and parents in the UAE regarding adolescents' attitudes, knowledge and behaviors toward CED consumption.

TI Fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway and incidence of type 2

AB Background
   De novo lipogenesis (DNL) is the primary metabolic pathway synthesizing fatty acids from carbohydrates, protein, or alcohol. Our aim was to examine associations of in vivo levels of selected fatty acids (16:0, 16:1n7, 18:0, 18:1n9) in DNL with incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D).
   Methods and findings
   Seventeen cohorts from 12 countries (7 from Europe, 7 from the United States, 1 from Australia, 1 from Taiwan; baseline years = 1970-1973 to 2006-2010) conducted harmonized individual-level analyses of associations of DNL-related fatty acids with incident T2D. In total, we evaluated 65,225 participants (mean ages = 52.3-75.5 years; % women = 20.4%62.3% in 12 cohorts recruiting both sexes) and 15,383 incident cases of T2D over the 9-year follow-up on average. Cohort-specific association of each of 16:0, 16:1n7, 18:0, and 18:1n9 with incident T2D was estimated, adjusted for demographic factors, socioeconomic characteristics, alcohol, smoking, physical activity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, menopausal status, and adiposity. Cohort-specific associations were meta-analyzed with an inverse-varianceweighted approach. Each of the 4 fatty acids positively related to incident T2D. Relative risks (RRs) per cohort-specific range between midpoints of the top and bottom quintiles of fatty acid concentrations were 1.53 (1.41-1.66; p< 0.001) for 16:0, 1.40 (1.33-1.48; p< 0.001) for 16:1n-7, 1.14 (1.05-1.22; p = 0.001) for 18:0, and 1.16 (1.07-1.25; p< 0.001) for 18:1n9. Heterogeneity was seen across cohorts (I-2 = 51.1%-73.1% for each fatty acid) but not explained by lipid fractions and global geographical regions. Further adjusted for triglycerides (and 16:0 when appropriate) to evaluate associations independent of overall DNL, the associations remained significant for 16:0, 16:1n7, and 18:0 but were attenuated for 18:1n9 (RR = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-1.13). These findings had limitations in potential reverse causation and residual confounding by imprecisely measured or unmeasured factors.
   Conclusions
   Concentrations of fatty acids in the DNL were positively associated with T2D incidence. Our findings support further work to investigate a possible role of DNL and individual fatty acids in the development of T2D.

AB The present study focused on investigating the antioxidant, antiglycation activity, digestive enzymes inhibition, bioaccessibility and hypoglycemic effect of C. arabica leaves extracts. The extracts deactivated the O-2(-), ROO? , H2O2, HOCl reactive oxygen species. Coffee leaves showed strong inhibition of alpha-glucosidase (IC50 = 40.30 mu g mL(-1)) greater than the isolated metabolites and acarbose. There was also inhibition of pancreatic lipase (IC50 = 56.43 mu g mL(-1)) in addition to a hypoglycemic effect in zebrafish similar to acarbose and metformin. With the exception of rutin, all biocompounds were detected at all stages of in vitro digestion. Finally, these results suggest that C. arabica leaf extracts possess antidiabetic and anti-obesity properties that can be attributed to the main metabolites and the synergistic action between them.

AB Obesity, characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, is a significant health concern. Phytochemicals found in plants are being explored for therapeutic use, particularly in combating obesity. Among these, theobromine, commonly found in cocoa and chocolate, shows promise. Although not as extensively studied as caffeine, theobromine exhibits positive effects on human health. It improves lipid profiles, aids in asthma treatment, lowers blood pressure, regulates gut microbiota, reduces tumor formation, moderates blood glucose levels, and acts as a neuroprotective agent. Studies demonstrate its anti-obesity effects through mechanisms such as browning of white adipose tissue, activation of brown adipose tissue, anti-inflammatory properties, and reduction of oxidative stress. This study aims to suggest theobromine as a potential therapeutic agent against obesity-related complications.

AB Obesity is a worldwide epidemic with severe metabolic consequences. Polyphenols are secondary metabolites in plants and the most abundant dietary antioxidants, which possess a wide range of health effects. The most relevant food sources are fruit and vegetables, red wine, black and green tea, coffee, virgin olive oil, and chocolate, as well as nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of a pure, isolated polyphenol supplementation to counteract the pernicious metabolic effects of a high-fat diet (HFD). Our results indicated that the administration of pure, isolated polyphenols under HFD conditions for 26 weeks worsened the glucose metabolism in diet-induced obese mice. The data showed that the main target organ for these undesirable effects were the kidneys, where we observed fibrotic, oxidative, and kidney-disease markers. This work led us to conclude that the administration of pure polyphenols as a food supplement would not be advisable. Instead, the ingestion of complete "whole" foods would be the best way to get the health effects of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols.

TI Evaluation of the Mexican warning label nutrient profile on food

AB BackgroundDifferent nutrient profiles (NPs) have been developed in Latin America to assess the nutritional quality of packaged food products. Recently, the Mexican NP was developed as part of the new warning label regulation implemented in 2020, considering 5 warning octagons (calories, sugar, sodium, saturated fats, and trans fats) and 2 warning rectangles (caffeine and non-nutritive sweeteners). The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the Mexican NP and other NPs proposed or used in Latin America against the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) model. Methods and findingsNutrition content data of 38,872 packaged food products available in the Mexican market were collected in 2016 and 2017. The evaluation of the Mexican NP, including its 3 implementation phases of increasing stringency (2020, 2023, and 2025), was conducted by comparing the percentage of products classified as "healthy" (without warnings) or "less healthy" (with 1 or more warnings), as well as the number and type of warnings assigned to food products, against the PAHO NP. Using the calibration method, we compared the classifications produced by the PAHO model against those produced by the NP models of Ecuador, Chile (3 phases), Peru (2 phases), Uruguay, and Brazil. Kappa coefficients and Pearson correlations were estimated, and proportion tests were performed. We found that the 3 implementation phases of the Mexican NP had near to perfect agreement in the classification of healthy foods (Mexico NP models: 19.1% to 23.8%; PAHO model: 19.7%) and a strong correlation (>91.9%) with the PAHO model. Other NPs with high agreement with the PAHO model were the Ecuador (89.8%), Uruguay (82.5%), Chile Phase 3 (82.3%), and Peru Phase 2 (84.2%) NPs. In contrast, the Peru Phase 1, Brazil, and Chile Phase 1 NP models had the highest percentage of foods classified as healthy (49.2%, 47.1%, and 46.5%, respectively) and the lowest agreement with the PAHO model (69.9%, 69.3%, and 73%, respectively). Study limitations include that warnings considered by the Mexican NP models were evaluated as if all the warnings were octagon seals, while 2 out of the 7 were rectangular warnings (caffeine and non-nutritive sweeteners), and that our data are limited by the quality of the information reported in the list of ingredients and the nutrition facts table of the products. ConclusionsThe 3 implementation phases of the Mexican NP were useful to identify healthy food products. In contrast, the Peru Phase 1, Brazil, and Chile Phase 1 NP models may have limited usefulness for the classification of foods according to the content of ingredients of concern. The results of this study may inform countries seeking to adapt and evaluate existing NP models for use in population-specific applications.
   Author summary Why was this study done? Nutrient profile models that reflect the nutritional quality of food products are needed to help governments and decision-makers seeking to adapt simplified front-of-package labeling systems in their countries.The calibration of a nutrient profile aims to determine whether the nutrient profile model classifies foods correctly against reference methods, increasing the evidence supporting the model and improving its confidence. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has developed a model that may work as a reference for Latin American countries.Several nutrient profiles have been developed and implemented in Latin America, with scarce evidence about their performance using representative databases of products of in the market.Even though the PAHO model was created for Latin American countries, it is relevant to adapt a nutrient profile model to local nutrition policies and epidemiology contexts. Recently, Mexico developed its own nutrient profile model based on the PAHO and Chile Phase 3 models, nutritional scientific population-based recommendations, and a feasibility analysis of products sold in the Mexican market. What did the researchers do and find? We compared the classification of a sample of more than 38,000 unique food products available in the Mexican market according to nutrient profile models from 6 countries (Mexico, Ecuador, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and Brazil) against the PAHO model.According to the PAHO model, the Mexican Phase 3 nutrient profile performed best in identifying unhealthy products based on their content of energy, sugar, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, non-nutritive sweeteners, and caffeine. This model had a strong correlation with the PAHO model (>91.9%). What do these findings mean? Our findings add support to the relevance of using the Mexican nutrient profile to evaluate the nutritional quality of food products as a basis for the prevention of obesity and chronic diseases related to diet.Our study has some limitations related to the quality of the information reported on the packages of the products included.

AB Green tea has garnered widespread interest in the past decades due to its content of health-beneficial polyphenols and catechins, besides reportedly exhibiting activities for the prevention, and possibly treatment, of many modern-life-associated afflictions. Hence, the functional food potential of health-beneficial beverages such as green tea is widely and commercially promoted. Biotransformation of green tea extract using enzymes such as tannase ostensibly enhances its beneficial well-being properties and disease-preventing functionalities. The tannase-treated green tea catechins may exhibit enhanced, amongst others, antioxidant, anti-tumour, anti-wrinkle, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity and anti-sarcopenia properties compared to native green tea extract. Nonetheless, the health benefits and therapeutic and toxicological effects associated with these compounds, before and after tannase treatment, present a scientific gap for detailed studies. Accordingly, the review surveys the literature from the late twentieth century until the year 2023 related to the aforementioned important aspects.

AB All recent guidelines on cardiovascular prevention have highlighted the role of a healthy diet and lifestyle advocating an holistic approach to reduce the cardiovascular burden among the population. Despite these efforts, registries have reported that only a minority of healthcare professionals provide advice on diet and lifestyle, and, in most cases, counseling is suboptimal for several reasons. Cardiovascular benefits linked to lifestyle and nutrition seem to be underestimated by many patients and doctors. This overview aims to summarize well-established benefits related to lifestyle and nutrition, discuss the current debates in this field in order to improve awareness among the medical community and promote better implementation of non-pharmaceutical measures to prevent the occurrence of atherothrombotic events, by reducing cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity.

AB Liubao tea, a traditional dark tea, has gained widespread recognition for various health benefits. In this study, the effects of Liubao tea extract (LTE) on obesity-related hyperlipidemia and the potential mechanism involved were explored. Anti-obesity compounds such as tricetin, isovitexin, tiliroside, etc. in LTE were identified. In high-fat diet mouse models, LTE effectively reduced tissues, organs, and body weight growth, and restored abnormal serum lipid levels. LTE could reverse adipocyte enlargement, lipid accumulation, and hepatic microstructure abnormalities. Notably, LTE reshaped gut microbiota by boosting beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides, Akkermansia, Psychrobacter) and suppressing harmful bacteria (e.g., Dubosiella, Faecalibaculum). Spearman correlation analysis unveiled significant associations between serum lipid levels, weight gain, LTE dosage, and gut microbiota, underlining the modulatory effects of LTE on metabolic disorders via the regulation of intestinal microbiota. Collectively, LTE could serve as a potential therapy for obesity-related hyperlipidemia prevention.

AB Background Diet and exercise play important roles in ameliorating metabolic syndrome. Yunkang 10 (Camellia sinensis var. assamica) is a most cultivated tea variety for making tea in the Southwestern China. Currently, there is no report of healthy effects of Yunkang 10 green tea (YKGT) and treadmill exercise (Ex) on high fat diet induced metabolic syndrome (MetS). We aimed to investigate the beneficial effects and molecular mechanism of YKGT and Ex using high fat diet induced MetS of C57BL/6 mice. Methods Catechins and caffeine in water extract of YKGT were measured via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 10-week old mice were fed with high fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks to induce obese mice. Then the obese mice were fed with continuous high fat diet (HFD), HFD with YKGT, HFD with Ex, and HFD with both YKGT and Ex for 8 weeks, respectively. The another group of 10-week old mice fed with low fat diet (LFD) were used as control. Results HPLC data revealed that YKGT has abundantly high concentration of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and caffeine compared to Longjing 43 (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis) green tea. YKGT and Ex significantly decreased the level of blood glucose, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), insulin, and alanine aminotransferase activity (ALT) when compared to HFD group. The fatty liver and hepatic pro-inflammatory gene expression in the YKGT, Ex and YKGT+Ex groups was mitigated significantly compared with HFD group, respectively. The phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase alpha/beta (IKK alpha/beta) and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B alpha (IkB alpha) protein in the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling pathway was also decreased in YKGT or YKGT+Ex groups. The combination of YKGT and Ex prevented gene expression for lipid synthesis in the liver tissue, and significantly upregulated mRNA level of glucose transport genes in the skeletal muscles, when compared to the HFD group. Conclusions This study demonstrated that YKGT supplement or exercise appeared to reverse preexisting metabolic syndrome, and effectively relieved the fatty liver and hepatic inflammatory response induced by high fat diet. YKGT supplement and treadmill exercise together had better beneficial effects than only one intervention.

AB Trigonelline, a major alkaloid component of fenugreek, has been demonstrated to have several biological activities, including antidiabetic and anticancer effects. This study aimed to examine the possible application of trigonelline as an anti-obesity compound based on an investigation of its enhancement of lipid catabolism and induction of browning in white adipocytes. Trigonelline induces browning of 3T3-L1 white adipocytes by enhancing the expressions of brown-fat signature proteins and genes as well as beige-specific genes, includingCd137,Cited1,Tbx1, andTmem26. Trigonelline also improves lipid metabolism in white adipocytes by decreasing adipogenesis and lipogenesis as well as promotes lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, trigonelline increases the expression ofCox4,Nrf1, andTfamgenes that are responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis. Mechanistic studies revealed that the browning effect of trigonelline in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes is mediated by activating beta 3-AR and inhibiting PDE4, thereby stimulating the p38 MAPK/ATF-2 signaling pathway. Considering its high bioavailability in humans and the results of this study, trigonelline may have potential as an anti-obesity compound.

AB Obesity is a public health crisis that has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, demanding urgent attention. To combat obesity, people endeavor to follow a healthy diet and regularly engage in physical activities. However, maintaining a healthy diet and physical activity is challenging, highlighting the need for novel effective therapies. This review aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of a well-researched functional food ingredient, green tea extract, for combating obesity. To assess the effectiveness of green tea extract, the review systematically examines various obesity indicators. It focuses on markers for body fat reduction in rodent models and humans, including weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and waist circumference. Furthermore, it explores the potential for suppressing and preventing obesity-related metabolic disorders. By thoroughly examining the effectiveness and mechanism of green tea extract, the study seeks to understand the potential of green tea extract as a nutraceutical/functional food for obesity management and prevention.

AB Obesity is becoming increasingly common all over the world and global strategies are accordingly being developed to prevent it. In order to support the strategies, the effects of green apple (Golden Delicious) and the consumption of its three major flavonols (quercetin-3-glucoside, quercetin-3-D-galactoside, and quercetin-3-rhamnoside) on body weight; the weight of liver, kidney, and spleen; some lipid parameters in serum; and total lipid ratios of liver and kidney and oxidative stress parameters of obese rats were studied. This study was conducted on two experimental groups: one of which was given an apple, and the other was given flavonols, in addition to their high-energy diet; along with a sham and a control rat group, for 4 weeks. According to results, there was no difference in body and organ weights between groups. The liver and kidney weights increased in obese rats, but there was no difference between the total lipid ratios in these organs. The addition of green apple and selected flavonols to the high-energy diet of rats was not sufficient to prevent the increase in body and organ weights, but it supported the reduction in some lipid fractions and in oxidative stress parameters of obese rats. Moreover, this study supported the argument that obesity causes most of the lipid fractions increase in serum and induces oxidative stress.

AB Obesity, a prevalent disease associated with numerous chronic conditions, including hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, remains a major global health challenge. This study investigated the potential of green tea (GT), fermented tea (FT), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) tea (GBT), which are rich in phytonutrients and polyphenols, for the management of obesity. Using a high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model (C57BL/6N), we explored the effect of these teas on various obesity-related parameters. The mice were categorized into five groups: normal diet with water, high-fat diet with water, and high-fat diet supplemented with GT, FT, or GBT. Over 13 weeks, we monitored body weight, perirenal and liver fat, adipocyte lipid accumulation, and key metabolic indicators, such as serum cholesterol, leptin, insulin, and fasting blood glucose. These teas contain beneficial phytochemicals such as GABA, theanine, and caffeine, and have demonstrated an enhanced antioxidant capacity, which increases the scavenging of free radicals and may reduce oxidative stress. The animal study indicated a decrease in feeding efficiency and significant reductions in body weight liver fat, epididymal fat, and perirenal fat, as well as in adipocyte lipid accumulation. Additionally, notable improvements were observed in metabolic health indicators, including reductions in serum cholesterol, leptin, insulin, and fasting blood glucose levels. Our findings revealed that GT, FT, or GBT significantly counteracted the negative effects of a high-fat diet, suggesting their potential in combating obesity and related metabolic disorders.

AB Background: Obesity is a state of accumulating excessive body fat, charactering by a high blood lipid and associating with various metabolic diseases. As a kind of dark tea, many studies revealed that long-term drinking Liupao tea (LT) can reduce weight (Liu et al., 2014). However, the anti-obesity mechanism and active ingredients of LT are not known.
   Methods: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) combined with network pharmacology was used to screen the active components and related targets of Liupao tea water extract (LTWE). The key anti-obesity targets and pathways of LTWE were predicted by protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and enrichment analyses using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology databases. Then, the active components selected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting were used together with LTWE in an adipogenic model and insulin resistance (IR) model in vitro.
   Results: Most of the compounds identified from LTWE were flavonofids, esters, and amides. Key targets such as RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, insulin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were involved in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, and other pathways. Four active components were screened by network pharmacology combined with HPLC fingerprinting. The in vitro experiment of LTWE and its four active components showed that in insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 cells, LTWE, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and gallic acid (GA) inhibited adipocyte differentiation. Three factors could inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells by decreasing gene expression of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), fatty acid synthase (FAS), CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins-alpha (C/EBP alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Caffeine and ellagic acid (EA) showed opposite results, but their effects on promoting adipose differentiation diminished with increasing concentrations of drug. In dexamethasone-induced insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 cells, the fluorescence intensity of 2-Deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-Benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-D-glucose revealed that LTWE, GA, EGCG, caffeine, and EA significantly promoted glucose consumption. LTWE, GA, and EA improved insulin resistance in adipocytes by upregulating gene expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), PI3K, AKT, and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4).
   Conclusion: LC-MS combined with network pharmacology preliminarianized that LTWE acts mainly on the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Cell experiments revealed that the anti-obesity effect of LTWE is the result of multicomponent action, which inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes by regulating gene expression of adipogenic transcription factors and proinflammatory factors, and improves IR by activating the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 pathway.

AB Purpose of Review The question whether food choice and eating behavior influence the mood or are influenced by the mood has been inquisitive to scientists and researchers. The purpose of this review is to support or refuse the argument that mood is affected by food or vice versa.
   Recent Findings The association between food and mood has been comprehensively elucidated in this review based on several studies that include participants from different ages, cultural backgrounds, and health status. The correlation among food, mood, and diseases such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and depression was thoroughly investigated. The effect of different foods and nutrients on the mood was further explained. It is concluded that the mood significantly affects food intake and food choices. On the other hand, food also influences the mood, which affects the diseases either positively or negatively.
   Summary Appropriate food choices play a significant role in mood enhancement. Advertisement is another crucial factor that negatively affects food choices and mood and contributes to many diseases. Understanding the interaction between food and mood can help to prevent or alleviate undesired health issues.

AB Pu-erh tea is a post-fermentation tea with unique flavor and multiple health benefits. Due to the various microorganisms involved in the post-fermentation process, Pu-erh tea contains highly complex components, which have rich interactions with the gut microbiomes (GMs). Because the structure and homeostasis of GMs are closely related to human wellness and the various diseases progress, the beneficial effects of Pu-erh tea on GMs have a great potential for application in health care. However, there is no systematic summary of the bioactive components of Pu-erh tea, and their effects on the GMs. Here, we review the current studies on the effects of Pu-erh tea and its bioactive components on the structure of GMs as well as on health improvement, and further discuss the relevant quality indicators. This "components - function - indicators" clue will hopefully stimulate the standardization of Pu-erh tea fermentation process and the development of its functional products.

AB This study was designed to explore the anti-obesity effects of cold-water brewed green tea (CWB-GT) on high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. CWB-GT was prepared by brewing tea leaves with 30 degrees C cold water, which contained considerable active ingredients including catechins, gallic acid and theanine. Our data demonstrated that CWB-GT could significantly ameliorate obesity and modulate gut micmbiota composition of HFD-fed mice by affecting some specific bacteria. Besides, the expression of lipogenesis-related genes including FAS, HMGR and SREBP-1c in liver was inhibited and the expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes including PPAR alpha and PGC-1 alpha in adipose tissue was enhanced. These benefits might be attributed to the stimulation of serum peptide YY (PYY) secretion. In particular, specific bacteria modulated by CWB-GT including Lachnospiraceae bacterium DW67, Blautia coccoides, Parabacteroides merdae and Bacteroides_vulgatus might be key mediators in exerting anti-obesity effects. This study suggested that CWB-GT could represent a novel functional low-calorie beverage.

AB Purpose During obesity, the adipose tissue is usually infiltrated by immune cells which are related to hallmarks of obesity such as systemic inflammation and insulin resistance (IR). Green tea (GT) has been widely studied for its anti-inflammatory actions, including the modulation in the proliferation and activity of immune cells, in addition to preventing cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Methods The aim of the present study was to analyze the population of immune cells present in the subcutaneous and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice kept at thermoneutrality (TN) and fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks, supplemented or not with GT extract (500 mg/kg/12 weeks). Results The HFD in association with TN has induced chronic inflammation, and IR in parallel with changes in the profile of immune cells in the subcutaneous and epidydimal WAT, increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines release, inflammatory cells infiltration, and fibrotic aspects in WAT. On the other hand, GT prevented body weight gain, in addition to avoiding IR and inflammation, and the consequent tissue fibrosis, maintaining a lower concentration of cytokines and a profile of immune cells similar to the control mice, preventing the harmful modulations induced by both HFD and TN. Conclusions GT beneficial effects in WAT abrogated the deleterious effects triggered by HFD and TN, maintaining all immune cells and fibrotic markers at the same level as in lean mice. These results place WAT immune cells population as a potential target of GT action, also highlighting the positive effects of GT in obese mice housed at TN.

AB The aim of this study is to observe the effects of Ninghong black tea extract on fat deposition and high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and to explore the potential mechanisms of these effect. Under 2% Ninghong black tea extract diet feeding in rat model, the results showed that Ninghong black tea extract decreased the body fat ratio and the number of lipid droplets in the liver and significantly alleviated NAFLD in the rat model. The real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed that Ninghong black tea extract significantly upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), which is important in fatty acid beta-oxidation, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which plays an important role in the synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). By promoting the expression of PPAR alpha and MTP in liver tissue and thereby promoting fatty acid beta-oxidation and VLDL synthesis, Ninghong black tea extract relieves high-fat diet-induced NAFLD.

AB Fermentation is one of the world's oldest techniques for food preservation, nutrient enhancement, and alcohol manufacturing. During fermentation, carbohydrates such as glucose and starch are converted into other molecules, such as alcohol and acid, anaerobically through enzymatic action while generating energy for the microorganism or cells involved. Black tea is among the most popular fermented beverages; it is made from the dried tea leaves of the evergreen shrub plant known as Camellia sinensis. The adequate consumption of black tea is beneficial to health as it contains high levels of flavanols, also known as catechins, which act as effective antioxidants and are responsible for protecting the body against the development of illnesses, such as inflammation, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and obesity. The prevalence of obesity is a severe public health concern associated with the incidence of various serious diseases and is now increasing, including in Malaysia. Advances in 'omic' research have allowed researchers to identify the pivotal role of the gut microbiota in the development of obesity. This review explores fermented black tea and its correlation with the regulation of the gut microbiota and obesity.

AB Tea is a traditional and popular beverage worldwide, and the consumption of tea has been demonstrated to possess many health benefits, such as cardiovascular protection, anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, and anticancer. Epidemiological studies have shown that the consumption of tea is inversely associated with the risk of several cancers. In addition, experimental studies have revealed that the anticancer actions of tea are mainly attributed to tea polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate and theaflavins. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the possible anticancer mechanisms are the inhibition on proliferation, anti-angiogenesis, induction of apoptosis, suppression on metastasis, inhibition on cancer stem cells, and modulation on gut microbiota. Its synergetic anticancer effects with drugs or other compounds could promote anticancer therapies. Furthermore, clinical trials have elucidated that intervention of tea phytochemicals is effective in the prevention of several cancers. This paper is an updated review for the prevention and management of cancers by tea based on the findings from epidemiological, experimental and clinical studies, and special attention is paid on the mechanisms of action.

AB Hypertension is considered to be both a cardiovascular disease and a risk factor for other cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary ischemia or stroke. In many cases, hypertension occurs in the context of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a condition in which other circumstances such as abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance are also present. The high incidence of MetS makes necessary the search for new strategies, ideally of natural origin and with fewer side effects than conventional pharmacological treatments. Among them, the tea plant is a good candidate, as it contains several bioactive compounds such as caffeine, volatile terpenes, organic acids, and polyphenols with positive biological effects. The aim of this study was to assess whether two new standardized tea extracts, one of white tea (WTE) and the other of black and green tea (CTE), exert beneficial effects on the cardiovascular alterations associated with MetS. For this purpose, male C57/BL6J mice were fed a standard diet (Controls), a diet high in fats and sugars (HFHS), HFHS supplemented with 1.6% WTE, or HFHS supplemented with 1.6% CTE for 20 weeks. The chromatography results showed that CTE is more concentrated on gallic acid, xanthines and flavan-3-ols than WTE. In vivo, supplementation with WTE and CTE prevented the development of MetS-associated hypertension through improved endothelial function. This improvement was associated with a lower expression of proinflammatory and prooxidant markers, and-in the case of CTE supplementation-also with a higher expression of antioxidant enzymes in arterial tissue. In conclusion, supplementation with WTE and CTE prevents the development of hypertension in obese mice; as such, they could be an interesting strategy to prevent the cardiovascular disorders associated with MetS.

DE obesity; weight loss; inflammation; lipid profile; oxidative stress
ID OXIDATIVE STRESS; GREEN
AB Background and Objectives: Obesity and related disorders are an increasing global health problem. Achieving and maintaining long-term weight loss through lifestyle changes and/or pharmacological interventions have not met expectations. Dietary supplements and alternative treatments have also shown limited effectiveness in this regard. The consumption of green tea in general has been shown to benefit obese patients, with effects attributed to caffeine, catechins, polyphenols and other components. However, the potential of white tea to prevent and treat the negative effects of obesity has not been addressed so far. In this study, the effect of white tea (WT) consumption in obese individuals was anthropometrically and biochemically investigated. Materials and Methods: Based on anthropometric and biochemical assessments, the patients were assigned to the control, orlistat, metformin and WT groups. Patients were given a diet and exercise program and one of either orlistat, metformin or WT for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12th week, the anthropometric and biochemical measurements were reassessed. Results: Body weight, waist circumference and BMI parameters decreased significantly in all groups. TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta and MMP-9 levels decreased significantly in the WT group. In addition, contrary to a significant elevation in HDL-C, the serum cholesterol, LDL-C and TG levels decreased significantly. Furthermore, leptin, ghrelin and asprosin levels decreased significantly. Serum glucose levels decreased significantly in all groups except for the control. In the WT group, while there was a significant decrease in the levels of serum PL MDA and 8-OHdG, the opposite was true for GSH. Conclusions: The oral consumption of WT, its availability and its potency in obesity treatment and prevention pave the way for further delineation of the mechanisms of actions of its bioactive compounds at the cellular and endocrinological levels.

AB Among Asian countries, South Korea was the first to approve liraglutide as a treatment for obesity. Thus, the clinical effectiveness of liraglutide has not been studied in Asian populations. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed obese patients [body mass index (BMI) >27 kg/m(2)] who were treated with liraglutide between March 2018 and March 2019 in a single clinic. Weight, BMI, HbA1c, and clinical data were collected before liraglutide treatment. Changes in body weight and composition and their relationships with clinical variables were examined at re-prescription dates within 30, 60, 90, and 180 days. A total of 169 subjects were studied. The average age was 41.5 years, and 42% of the subjects were male. The average weight was 85.2 kg, and the average BMI was 30.8 kg/m(2). Weight reduction was significant (-5.5 +/- 3.4 kg, 30 days: -3.2 +/- 1.8 kg, 60 days: -4.5 +/- 2.3 kg, 90 days: -6.3 +/- 2.6 kg, 180 days: -7.8 +/- 3.5 kg) during the follow-up period and increased with longer treatment time (P < .001). The percentages of subjects that showed >= 5% and >= 10% body weight reduction were 62.1% and 17.2%, respectively. In the body composition analysis, skeletal muscle weight loss was -3.56 +/- 29.7%, which was significantly smaller than fat weight loss of -11.06 +/- 10.4% (P = .03). Weight loss was not significantly related to age, sex, baseline BMI, baseline HbA1c, smoking status, alcohol consumption, coffee intake. In conclusion, Liraglutide treatment led to meaningful weight loss in South Korean patients, and fat mass reduction was prominent during treatment. Furthermore, liraglutide showed greater clinical effectiveness with longer treatment time.

AB Background: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a role in modulating energy expenditure. People with obesity have been shown to have reduced activation of BAT. Agents such as beta-agonists, capsinoids, thyroid hormone, sildenafil, caffeine, or cold exposure may lead to activation of BAT in humans, potentially modulating metabolism to promote weight loss. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases for clinical trials testing the effect of these agents and cold exposure on energy expenditure/thermogenesis and the extent to which they may impact weight loss in adults. Results : A total of 695 studies from PubMed, Web of Science, and Medline electronic databases were identified. After the removal of duplicates and further evaluation, 47 clinical trials were analyzed. We observed significant heterogeneity in the duration of interventions and the metrics utilized to estimate thermogenesis/energy expenditure. Changes observed in energy expenditure do not correlate with major weight changes with different interventions commonly known to stimulate thermogenesis. Even though cold exposure appears to consistently activate BAT and induce thermogenesis, studies are small, and it appears to be an unlikely sustainable therapy to combat obesity. Most studies were small and potential risks associated with known side effects of some agents such as beta-agonists (tachycardia), sibutramine (hypertension, tachycardia), thyroid hormone (arrhythmias) cannot be fully evaluated from these small trials. Conclusion: Though the impact of BAT activation and associated increases in energy expenditure on clinically meaningful weight loss is a topic of great interest, further data is needed to determine long-term feasibility and efficacy.

AB Yerba mate, a herbal tea derived from Ilex paraguariensis, has previously been reported to be protective against obesity-related and other cardiometabolic disorders. Using high-resolution respirometry and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, the effects of four weeks of yerba mate consumption on mitochondrial efficiency and cellular redox status in skeletal muscle, adipose, and liver, tissues highly relevant to whole-body metabolism, were explored in healthy adult mice. Yerba mate treatment increased the mitochondrial oxygen consumption in adipose but not in the other examined tissues. Yerba mate increased the ATP concentration in skeletal muscle and decreased the ATP concentration in adipose. Combined with the observed changes in oxygen consumption, these data yielded a significantly higher ATP:O-2, a measure of mitochondrial efficiency, in muscle and a significantly lower ATP:O-2 in adipose, which was consistent with yerba mate-induced weight loss. Yerba mate treatment also altered the hepatic glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) redox potential to a more reduced redox state, suggesting the treatment's potential protective effects against oxidative stress and for the preservation of cellular function. Together, these data indicate the beneficial, tissue-specific effects of yerba mate supplementation on mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox states in healthy mice that are protective against obesity.

AB There are a wide variety of phytochemicals collectively known as polyphenols. Their structural diversity results in a broad range of characteristics and biological effects. Polyphenols can be found in a variety of foods and drinks, including fruits, cereals, tea, and coffee. Studies both in vitro and in vivo, as well as clinical trials, have shown that they possess potent antioxidant activities, numerous therapeutic effects, and health advantages. Dietary polyphenols have demonstrated the potential to prevent many health problems, including obesity, atherosclerosis, high blood sugar, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and neurological diseases. In this paper, the protective effects of polyphenols and the mechanisms behind them are investigated in detail, citing the most recent available literature. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on the role of polyphenols in preventing and managing chronic diseases. The cited publications are derived from in vitro, in vivo, and human-based studies and clinical trials. A more complete understanding of these naturally occurring metabolites will pave the way for the development of novel polyphenol-rich diet and drug development programs. This, in turn, provides further evidence of their health benefits.

AB The French National Cancer Institute conducted a collective expertise study with researchers and clinical experts from the French Network for Nutrition And Cancer Research (NACRe Network). The objective was to update the state of knowledge on the impacts of nutritional factors on clinical endpoints during or after cancer. Data from 150 meta-analyses, pooled analyses or intervention trials and 93 cohort studies were examined; they concerned 8 nutritional factors, 6 clinical events and 20 cancer locations. This report shows that some nutritional factors have impacts on mortality and on the risks of recurrence or second primary cancer in cancer patients. Therefore, high-risk nutritional conditions can be encountered for certain cancer sites: from the diagnosis and throughout the health care pathways, weight loss (lung and esophageal cancers), malnutrition (lung, esophageal, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric and liver cancers), weight gain (colorectal, breast and kidney cancers) and alcohol consumption (upper aerodigestive cancers) should be monitored; and after cancer treatments, excess weight should be detected (colorectal, breast and kidney cancers). These situations require nutritional assessments, and even support or management by health care professionals, in the context of tertiary prevention. This report also highlights some limitations regarding the existing literature and some needs for future research.

AB The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is one of the major health hazards and an epidemic worldwide. There is no known best remedy has been defined yet. In the current investigation, we designed a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the beneficial effects of tea consumption in alleviating metabolic syndromes. Herein, we accumulated the relevant literature available on PubMed and EMBASE databases from January, 2000 to August, 2019. RCTs bearing impact factor of at least 1 or more were studied for the effect of tea consumption on MetS. This meta-analysis suggested that tea consumption has beneficial effects on diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and this finding was characterized of all types of tea in the current study and also for body mass index (BMI) value. Furthermore, this analysis also found that black tea consumption has protective effects on systolic SBP, green tea reduces the incidence of diabetes and lower the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. These functions required BMI value at least 28 or higher. The meta data led us to conclude that tea consumption have protective effects on MetS, however, different types of tea might have different protective mechanisms on MetS, but, exact mechanisms are not yet clear and needs to be explored.

AB Background: Obesity is a global public health concern and increases the risk of metabolic syndrome and other diseases. The anti-obesity effects of various plant-derived bioactive compounds, such as tea extracts, are well-established. The mechanisms underlying the anti-obesity activity of Jinxuan green tea (JXGT) from different storage years are still unclear.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of JXGTs from three different years on the high fat diet (HFD)-fed mouse model.
   Design: The mice were divided into six groups, the control group received normal diet and the obese model group received HFD. We analyzed the effects of JXGTs from 2005, 2008, and 2016 on HFD-fed obese mice over a period of 7 weeks.
   Results: The JXGTs reduced the body weight of the obese mice, and also alleviated fat accumulation and hepatic steatosis. Mechanistically, JXGTs increased the plosplorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) ratio, up-regulated carnitine acyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), and down-regulated fatty acid synthase (FAS), Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3 beta), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-lalpha (PGC-1 alpha), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Thus, JXGTs can alleviate HFD-induced obesity by inhibiting lipid biosynthesis and inflammation, thereby promoting fatty acid oxidation via the AMPK pathway.
   Discussion: The anti-obesity effect of three aged JXGTs were similar. However, JXGT2016 exhibited a more potent activation of AMPK, and JXGT2005 and JXGT2008 exhibited a more potent inhibiting glycogen synthase and inflammation effect. Furthermore, the polyphenol (-)-epicatechin (EC) showed the strongest positive correlation with the anti-obesity effect of JXGT.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that JXGT treatment has a potential protection on HFD-induced obesity mice via activating the AMPK/CPT-1A and down-regulating FAS/GSK-3 beta/PGC-1 alpha and IL-6/TNF alpha. Our study results also revealed that different storage time would not affect the anti-obesity and anti-inflammation effect of JXGT.

AB Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a regulator of addictive behavior. Increasing evidence suggests an impact of FGF21 on eating behavior, food and drug cravings and on other adipokines like insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) or adiponectin. We investigated the association of serum FGF21 and genetic variants with aspects of food and drug craving and obesity related metabolic parameters including serum adipokine levels. Standardized questionnaires, blood samples and anthropometric data of the Sorbs cohort (n = 1046) were analyzed using SPSS. For genetic analyses, the FGF21-locus +/- 10 kb was genotyped and analyzed using PLINK. Validation was conducted in a second independent cohort (n = 704). FGF21 was significantly associated with alcohol and coffee consumption, smoking and eating behavior (disinhibition). We confirmed correlations of FGF21 serum levels with IGF-1, adiponectin, pro-enkephalin, adipocyte fatty-acid-binding protein, chemerin and progranulin. FGF21 genetic variants were associated with anthropometric and metabolic parameters, adipokines, food and drug craving while strongest evidence was seen with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We highlight the potential role of FGF21 in food and drug cravings and provide new insights regarding the link of FGF21 with other adipokines as well as with metabolic traits, in particular those related to lipid metabolism (LDL-C).

AB Background
   Obesity has been reported to be an important contributing factor for precocious puberty, especially in girls. The effect of green tea polyphenols on weight reduction in adult population has been shown, but few related studies have been conducted in children. This study was performed to examine the effectiveness and safety of decaffeinated green tea polyphenols (DGTP) on ameliorating obesity and early sexual development in girls with obesity.
   Design
   This is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Girls with obesity aged 6-10 years old were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg/day DGTP or isodose placebo orally for 12 weeks. During this period, all participants received the same instruction on diet and exercise from trained dietitians. Anthropometric measurements, secondary sexual characteristics, B-scan ultrasonography of uterus, ovaries and breast tissues, and related biochemical parameters were examined and assessed pre- and post-treatment.
   Results
   Between August 2018 and January 2020, 62 girls with obesity (DGTP group n = 31, control group n = 31) completed the intervention and were included in analysis. After the intervention, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio significantly decreased in both groups, but the percentage of body fat (PBF), serum uric acid (UA), and the volumes of ovaries decreased significantly only within the DGTP group. After controlling confounders, DGTP showed a significantly decreased effect on the change of PBF (beta = 2.932, 95% CI: 0.214 to 5.650), serum UA (beta = 52.601, 95% CI: 2.520 to 102.681), and ovarian volumes (right: beta = 1.881, 95% CI: 0.062 to 3.699, left: beta = 0.971, 95% CI: 0.019 to 1.923) in girls with obesity. No side effect was reported in both groups during the whole period.
   Conclusion
   DGTP have shown beneficial effects of ameliorated obesity and postponed early sexual development in girls with obesity without any adverse effects.

AB Purpose of review In this review, authors have selected from literature the most recent and suggestive studies on therapy of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The selected interventions regulate the action of gastrointestinal peptides, such as gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), nesfatin, peptide YY, cholecystokinin, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). These hormones have been found frequently modified in obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, morbidities mostly associated with NAFLD. This disease has a very high prevalence worldwide and could evolve in a more severe form, that is, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis. The findings shown by this article describe the metabolic effects of new drugs, mainly but not only, as well of some old substances. Recent findings Recent approaches, in animal models or in humans, use synthetic GLP-1 receptor agonists, a centrally administered antibody neutralizing GIP receptor, curcumin, compound being active on nesfatin, resveratrol (antiinflammatory agent), and Ginseg, both of them acting on nesfatin, a cholecystokinin receptor analogue, and finally coffee functioning on YY peptide. The implications of the presented findings, if they are confirmed in larger clinical trials, likely open the door to future application in clinical practice. In fact, nowadays, patients have only diet and article (incl abstract and keywords) exercise as well accepted recommendations. Thus, there are unmet needs to find substances that could really improve the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis toward liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB The prevalence of obesity is alarmingly increasing in the last few decades and leading to many serious public health concerns worldwide. The dysregulated lipid homeostasis due to various genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors is considered one of the critical putative pathways mediating obesity. Nonetheless, the scientific advancements unleashing the molecular dynamics of lipid metabolism have provided deeper insights on the emerging roles of lipid hydrolysing enzymes, including pancreatic lipase. It is hypothesized that inhibiting pancreatic lipase would prevent the breakdown of triglyceride and delays the absorption of fatty acids into the systemic circulation and adipocytes. Whilst, orlistat is the only conventional pancreatic lipase enzyme inhibitor available in clinics, identifying the safe clinical alternatives from plants to inhibit pancreatic lipase has been considered a significant advancement. Consequently, plants which have shown significant potential to combat obesity are now revisited for its abilities to inhibit pancreatic lipase. In this regard, our review surveyed the potential of medicinal plants and its phytoconstituents to inhibit pancreatic lipase and to elicit anti-obesity effects. Thus, the review collate and critically appraise the potential of medicinal plants and phyto-molecules inhibiting pancreatic lipase enzyme and consequently modulating triglyceride absorption in gut, and discuss its implications in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat obesity.

AB The flower of tea (Camellia sinensis L.) plant has been paid an increasing attention in the last twenty years, since it was found that tea flowers contained representative constituents similar to those of tea leaves, such as catechins, caffeine and amino acids. Tea flower is theoretically valuable although it has been considered as an industrial waste over a long period of time. This review summarizes the research findings conducted until now on physiological genetics, chemical composition, health benefits and toxicology of tea flowers, aiming to foresee their future applications. A lot of genes are involved in flower development and the synthesis and transmission of various chemicals in tea flowers. The chemical composition of tea flower consists mainly of catechins, polysaccharides, proteins, amino acids and saponins and thus tea flower possesses various health benefits such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunostimulating, antitumor, hypoglycemic, anti-obesity and anti-allergic activities. Moreover, tea flower contains a protease that can elevate the free amino acids content in the tea infusion by almost two folds. More importantly, the enzymatic activity of the protease is much higher than that of the commercially available proteases. Additionally, aqueous extracts of tea flower are demonstrated to safe to animals. Thus, the potential uses of tea flowers in food and medical fields are warranted.

AB Polyphenols are bioactive compounds from plants with antioxidant properties that may have a protective role against body weight gain, with adipose tissue and systemic oxidative stress as potential targets. We aimed to investigate the dietary intake of individual polyphenols and their association with 5-year body weight change in a sub-cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). This study included 349,165 adult participants from nine European countries. Polyphenol intake was estimated through country-specific validated dietary questionnaires and the Phenol-Explorer database. Body weight was obtained at recruitment and after a mean follow-up time of 5 years. Associations were estimated using multilevel mixed linear regression models. From 91 polyphenols included, the majority (n = 67) were inversely associated with 5-year body weight change after FDR-correction (q < 0.05). The greatest inverse associations were observed for quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside (change in weight for doubling in intake: -0.071 (95% CI: -0.085; -0.056) kg/5 years). Only 13 polyphenols showed positive associations with body weight gain, mainly from the subclass hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) with coffee as the main dietary source, such as 4-caffeoylquinic acid (0.029 (95% CI: 0.021; 0.038) kg/5 years). Individual polyphenols with fruit, tea, cocoa and whole grain cereals as the main dietary sources may contribute to body weight maintenance in adults. Individual HCAs may have different roles in body weight change depending on their dietary source.

AB Purpose: The Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene is a significant contributor to dyslipidemia. It has shown associations with several conditions including atherosclerosis, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). We assessed the interactive association between MetS and rs3779788 of the LPL gene based on aerobic exercise. Materials and Methods: Data were available for 7532 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants recruited between 2008 and 2016. We used multiple logistic regression to determine the odds ratios (OR) for MetS and their 95% confident intervals (C.I.). Potential variables included LPL rs3779788, aerobic exercise, sex, age, education, marital status, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, midnight snacking, vegetarian diet, coffee, dietary fat, and tea drinking. Results: Aerobic exercise was protective against MetS (OR, 0.858; 95% C.I., 0.743-0.991). Compared to CC/CT genotype, the OR for developing MetS was 0.875, (95% C.I., 0.571- 1.341) in TT individuals. The test for interaction was significant for the rs3779788 variant and aerobic exercise (p = 0.0484). In our group analyses, the OR for MetS was 0.841 (95% C.I., 0.727-0.974) in CC/CT and 4.076 (95% C.I., 1.158-14.346) in TT individuals who did aerobic exercise compared to those who did not. Conclusion: Our study indicated that aerobic exercise improved metabolic syndrome in Taiwanese adults with rs3779788 CC/CT genotype relative to those with TT genotype.

AB The promotion of healthful dietary intake in adolescents is an important public health concern, as obesity is on the rise among adolescents. The current study aimed to determine the association between sociodemographic characteristics and dietary intake (breakfast, vegetables, milk, fruits, fast food, carbohydrate beverages, and caffeine beverages) and to examine the influences of physical and mental health on dietary intake. A nationally representative sample of 187,622 adolescents who attended middle and high schools and participated in the Korean Youth Risk Behavior Survey (2015, 2017, and 2019) was used. The results showed a decrease in breakfast, vegetable, milk, and fruit consumption and an increase in the obesity rate from 2015 to 2019. There was a significant association between dietary intake and gender, economic status, BMI, and academic achievement. Multiple logistic regression analysis results revealed that the consumption of breakfast, vegetables, milk, and fruit were associated with greater odds of having enough sleep. Fast food intake was shown to be a significant risk factor for depression with an odds ratio of 1.204 (95% CI = 1.169-1.239), and carbonated beverage consumption was shown to be a significant risk factor for stress with an odds ratio of 1.042 (95% CI = 1.030-1.054). These results provide fundamental data that can be used to develop an effective nutrition intervention program or nutrition policy for adolescents or school food service programs.

Dietary data (n= 562) from the cross-sectional Malaysia Lipid Study were used to derive DPs through principal component analysis. Associations of DPs were examined with metabolic syndrome (MetS), atherogenic, inflammation and insulinemic status. Four DPs with distinctive eating modes were Home meal (HM), Chinese traditional (CT), Plant foods (PF) and Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB). Within DP tertiles (T3 vs. T1), the significantly lowest risk was associated with CT for hsCRP (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.28, 0.70,p< 0.001) levels. However, SSB was associated with the significantly highest risks for BMI (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.28, 3.17,p= 0.003), waist circumference (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.14, 2.87,p= 0.013), small LDL-C particles (AOR= 1.69, 95% CI 1.02, 2.79,p= 0.043), HOMA2-IR (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.25, 5.57,p= 0.011), hsCRP (AOR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.40, 3.50,p= 0.001), and MetS (AOR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.49, 5.22,p= 0.001). Adherence behaviors to SSBs (T3) included consuming coffee/tea with condensed milk (29%) or plain with sugar (20.7%) and eating out (12 +/- 8 times/week,p< 0.001). Overall, the SSB pattern with a highest frequency of eating out was detrimentally associated with cardiometabolic risks.

AB Objective:To identify the prevalence and factors related to obesity and fast food consumption among university students.
   Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted at Mutah University, Al-Karak governorate in southern Jordan, from January to April, 2019, and comprised students recruited from different faculties. Data was collected using a structured, validated questionnaire. Height and weight were measured for body mass index calculation. Data was analysed using SPSS 23.
   Results: Of the 503 students, 278(55.3%) were females. The overall mean age of the sample was 21.62 +/- 2.22 years (range: 19-39 years). Fast food consumption was >= 2 times/week for 299(59.4%) students. The prevalence was significantly higher among students spending >= 21 Jordanian dinar per week (p=0.020) and those who were not performing physical exercise (p=0.025). Significant correlations were found between fast food consumption and fried potato (p<0.001), processed meat products (p<0.001), coffee (p=0.006) and candies (p=0.039). No significant relation was found between fast food consumption and body mass index, religion, gender, field of study or living away from family (p>0.05). The most common reason for consumption was shortage of time 115(38.5%); lunch time was the most preferred time 210(70.2%); 97(32.4%) students were willing to read the nutrient information; and 211(70.5%) were interested in choosing healthy meals.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of fast food consumption among university students was found to be high.

AB Adipose tissue is usually laid down in small amounts in the foetus and is characterised as possessing small amounts of the brown adipose tissue-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP)1. In adults, a primary factor determining the abundance and function of UCP1 is ambient temperature. Cold exposure causes activation and the rapid generation of heat through the free flow of protons across the mitochondria with no requirement to convert ADP to ATP. In rodents, housing at an ambient temperature below thermoneutrality promotes the appearance of beige like adipocytes. These arise as discrete regions of UCP1 containing cells in white fat depots. There is increasing evidence to show that to gain credible translational results on brown and beige fat function in rodent models that they should be housed at thermoneutrality. This not only reflects the type of environment in which humans spend a majority of their time, but is in accord with the rise of global temperature caused by industrialisation and the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels. There is now good evidence in adult humans, that stimulating brown fat can improve glucose homeostasis which can be achieved either by nutritional or pharmacological interventions. The challenge, therefore, is to establish credible developmental models in animals maintained at thermoneutrality which will elucidate the true impact of nutrition. The primary focus should fall specifically on the components of breast milk and how these modulate long term effects on brown or beige fat development and function.

AB We have shown that combination treatment with decaffeinated green tea extract (GTE) and voluntary exercise (Ex) reduces obesity and insulin resistance in high-fat (HF)-fed mice to a greater extent than either treatment alone. Here, we investigated the effects of GTE-, Ex- or the combination on the development of obesity-related NAFLD. Male C57BL/6 J mice were treated for 16 weeks with HF diet (60% energy from fat), HF supplemented with 7.7 g GTE/kg, HF plus access to a voluntary running wheel, or the combination. We found that treatment of mice with the combination mitigated the development of HF-induced NAFLD to a greater extent than either treatment alone. Combination-treated mice had lower plasma alanine aminotransferase (92% lower) and hepatic lipid accumulation (80% lower) than HF-fed controls: the effect of the single treatments was less significant. Mitigation of NAFLD was associated with higher fecal lipid and nitrogen levels. Combination treated, but not singly treated mice, had higher hepatic expression of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis (sirtuin 1[59%]; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha [42%]; nuclear respiratory factor 1[38%]; and transcription factor B1, mitochondrial [89%]) compared to the HF-fed controls. GTE-, Ex-, and the combination-treatment groups also had higher hepatic expression of genes related to cholesterol synthesis and uptake, but the combination was not better than the single treatments. Our results suggest the combination of GTE and Ex can effectively mitigate NAFLD. Future studies should determine if the combination is additive or synergistic compared to the single treatments.

AB Background Low-diversity diets and sedentary status are risk factors for depressive symptoms, while knowledge workers were ignored before. The purpose of this current study was to examine the relationship between dietary diversity, sedentary time spent outside of work, and depressive symptoms among knowledge workers.Study design and methods This was a multicenter and cross-sectional design that included 118,723 knowledge workers. Participants self-reported online between January 2018 and December 2020. Demographic information, the Dietary Diversity Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, dietary habits (which included eating three meals on time, midnight snacking, overeating, social engagement, coffee consumption, sugary drink consumption, smoking and alcohol use), sedentary time spent outside of work and physical activity were investigated.Results The relationships between demographic information, dietary habits and dietary diversity, and depressive symptoms were estimated. Compared with the first and second levels of dietary diversity, the third level of dietary diversity (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84-0.98) reduced the risk of depressive symptoms. Knowledge workers with different degrees of sedentary status (2-4 h (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.07-1.14), 4-6 h (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.17-1.26), and > 6 h (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.43-1.56), presented a progressively higher risk of depressive symptoms.Conclusion High amounts of sedentary time spent after work and low levels of dietary diversity are risk factors for depressive symptoms. In addition, an irregular diet and overeating are also major risk factors for knowledge workers.

AB BackgroundEarly identification of modifiable risk factors is essential for the prevention of frailty. This study aimed to explore the causal relationships between a spectrum of genetically predicted risk factors and frailty. MethodsUnivariable and multivariable Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses were performed to explore the relationships between 22 potential risk factors and frailty, using summary genome-wide association statistics. Frailty was accessed by the frailty index. ResultsGenetic liability to coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), ischaemic stroke, atrial fibrillation and regular smoking history, as well as genetically predicted 1-SD increase in body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, alcohol intake frequency and sleeplessness were significantly associated with increased risk of frailty (all p<0.001). In addition, there was a significant inverse association between genetically predicted college or university degree with risk of frailty (beta -0.474; 95% CI (-0.561 to -0.388); p<0.001), and a suggestive inverse association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level with risk of frailty (beta -0.032; 95% CI (-0.055 to -0.010); p=0.004). However, no significant causal associations were observed between coffee consumption, tea consumption, serum level of total testosterone, oestradiol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, C reactive protein or moderate to vigorous physical activity level with frailty (all p>0.05). Results of the reverse directional MR suggested bidirectional causal associations between T2DM and CAD with frailty. ConclusionsThis study provided genetic evidence for the causal associations between several modifiable risk factors with lifetime frailty risk. A multidimensional approach targeting these factors may hold a promising prospect for prevention frailty.

AB Background: Tea consumption is widely reported to have beneficial effects on metabolic functions. The current study is to evaluate the association between habitual tea consumption and risk for metabolic syndrome and its components among Chinese adults aged 18 similar to 59 years. Methods: 43,757 participants aged 18 similar to 59 years from China Nutrition and Health Surveillance 2015-2017 were included and divided into four groups based on the amount of daily tea consumption in the current study. Using multiple-adjustment logistic regression to explore the relationship between habitual tea consumption and metabolic syndrome-related health outcomes. Results: Compared with those who did not consume tea habitually, participants who drank over 5 cups of tea per day showed a significantly lower risk of metabolic syndrome (OR = 0.836, 95% CI = 0.771-0.905), blood pressure elevated (OR = 0.906, 95% CI = 0.845-0.972), triglyceride elevated (OR = 0.797, 95% CI = 0.741-0.857), and fasting plasma glucose elevated (OR = 0.772, 95% CI = 0.715-0.833), but higher risk for central obesity (OR = 1.354, 95% CI = 1.236-1.484). Regardless of gender, higher tea consumption was related to lower risk of triglyceride and fasting blood glucose elevated but higher risk for central obesity. While for protective effect on metabolic syndrome, blood pressure elevated, and HDL-C reduction only showed in females. Conclusions: Results from current study support that habitual tea consumption would benefit metabolic syndrome and its related components, especially among females.

AB Most patients report "taste" changes after undergoing metabolic surgeries. Yet, most studies that used validated sensory evaluation techniques, including ours, found no changes in perceived taste intensity from before to after surgery. However, we assessed participants with pure gustatory stimuli and after an overnight fast, which raises questions about whether patients' self-reported "taste" changes are due to conflating changes in retronasal smell/"flavor" with taste changes or whether they only manifest during the fed state. To investigate this, we conducted a cross-sectional study comparing sensory responses in women who underwent metabolic surgery 2 to 6 yr ago (n = 15) with 2 nonoperated control groups: one with a body mass index (BMI) equivalent (n = 15) and one with a healthy BMI (n = 15). Participants attended 2 sessions, one fed and one fasted. Using a sip-and-spit method, women tasted liquid samples containing gustatory and olfactory stimuli and puddings with varying fat content with and without nose clips. They used separate general labeled magnitude scales to rate their perceived intensity of taste, smell, flavor, and liking. Mixed ANOVAs indicated that the surgery and BMI equivalent groups rated retronasal smell intensity of coffee stronger than the healthy BMI group (P <= 0.015). However, there were no differences in taste/flavor intensity or liking ratings among groups. Additionally, feeding conditions did not significantly affect perceived intensity ratings. Our findings suggest that changes in the sensory-discriminatory component of taste or taste-odor interactions are not significant contributors to dietary modifications following metabolic surgery.

AB Objective: To assess the food environment at OsloMet, through the nutritional profile and processing level of available commercial foods and drinks, as well as to determine food-purchasing behaviours, preferences and opinions on the food environment, in order to identify whether interventions on campus need to be conducted. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Setting: Pilestredet and Kjeller campus of OsloMet (Norway). Participants: To analyse the nutritional profile of products offered at all food outlets (seven canteens, three coffee shops and two vending machines) at the main campuses three criteria were applied: those proposed by the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition, the UK nutrient profiling model and those of the Food and Drink Industry Professional Practices Committee Norway. In addition, products were classified by processing level, using the NOVA system. Food purchasing, food choice behaviours and opinions were analysed through a survey online, in which 129 subjects participated. Results: With regard to the first of the objectives, the combination of the above-mentioned criteria showed that 39 center dot 8 % of the products were 'unhealthy' and 85 center dot 9 % were 'ultra-processed'. Regarding the second objective, the most important determinants of food choice were taste, convenience, and cost and nutrition/health value. The most common improvements suggested were lowering the cost, improving the allergen information on labelling and increasing the variety of fresh and healthy foods. Conclusions: A high proportion of the products offered were considered 'unhealthy' and highly processed. Interventions that improve food prices, availability and information on labelling would be well-received in this community.

AB BackgroundLADA is a common form of diabetes described as a mix between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Understanding of how genes and environmental factors interact in the development of LADA is central for future efforts to prevent the disease. This review aims to synthesize the literature on lifestyle factors linked to LADA risk and discuss their potential interaction with genetic susceptibility. FindingsCurrent knowledge on environmental risk factors for LADA is primarily based on observational data from Scandinavian populations. Increasing evidence suggest that lifestyle factors promoting type 2 diabetes such as obesity, sedentariness, low birth weight and smoking, is implicated in the risk of LADA. Data from mendelian randomization studies support that the link between LADA and obesity, low birth weight and smoking is causal. Limited evidence indicates that dietary factors including consumption of red meat, coffee and sweetened beverages may increase the risk while consumption of alcohol and omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk. Several lifestyle factors, including smoking and obesity, seem to interact with human leukocyte antigen genes associated with autoimmunity, conferring much stronger effects on disease risk among those exposed to both factors. Available studies suggest that lifestyle modification has the potential for prevention of LADA, particularly for individuals with high risk of disease such as those with genetic susceptibility. Research into risk factors of LADA is however limited, confirmations are warranted, many factors remain to be explored, and there is a need for intervention studies to assess causality

AB BackgroundWe sought to explore the perceptions of the socio-cultural contexts and health concerns of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) among Indian adults working or studying at a post-secondary institution in Karnataka, India.MethodsWe completed a qualitative study, including 24 semi-structured interviews between 2017 and 2018 at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, Karnataka, India. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis.ResultsOne over-arching theme emerged, westernization and changing perceptions of food, sugar, and health. Participants discussed SSB and associated health concerns in the broad context of westernization and overall economic development in India. Three sub-themes regarding the health perceptions of consuming SSB were: healthy drinks are clean and natural; hydration and energy; and moderation and body weight. Hygienically-prepared beverages were a consistent concern among participants. Juices and beverages, such as tea or coffee, sweetened with jaggery were viewed positively due to their naturalness and lack of processed sugar. Participants perceived SSB as providing hydration and energy, particularly in hot weather. Lastly, if consumed in moderation, SSB were thought to have no direct adverse health consequences. Though some participants noted excessive, 'addictive' consumption would contribute to weight gain and diabetes.ConclusionPerceived health concerns of SSB reflect dominant health issues in India, namely, food insecurity, food safety, and increasingly, diabetes. Policymakers tend to prioritize acute challenges over long-term concerns. As such, the capacity of any policy to address chronic nutritional concerns related to SSB are likely to be muted in the absence of improvements to food safety and security.

AB With the rising prevalence of diabetes and its association with cognitive impairment, interest in the use of dietary alkaloids and other natural products has grown significantly. Understanding how these compounds manage diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD) is crucial. This comprehensive review explores the etiology of DCD and the effects of alkaloids in foods and dietary supplements that have been investigated as DCD therapies. Data on how dietary alkaloids like berberine, trigonelline, caffeine, capsaicin, 1-deoxynojirimycin, nuciferine, neferine, aegeline, tetramethylpyrazine, piperine, and others regulate cognition in diabetic disorders were collected from PubMed, Research Gate, Web of Science, Science Direct, and other relevant databases. Dietary alkaloids could improve memory in behavioral models and modulate the mechanisms underlying the cognitive benefits of these compounds, including their effects on glucose metabolism, gut microbiota, vasculopathy, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Evidence suggests that dietary alkaloids hold promise for improving cognition in diabetic patients and could open exciting avenues for future research in diabetes management.
   Diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD), a cognitive impairment associated with diabetes, stems from disturbances in glucose metabolism, including insulin resistance, abnormal blood sugar levels, and obesity. These disruptions lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, vascular injury, and altered gut microbiota. As a result, metabolic imbalances, increased oxidative stress, and inflammation contribute to NDD-like neuropathy, affecting cognitive function. Alkaloids found in food and dietary supplements offer potential for managing these underlying causes and supporting DCD treatment.image

AB Background Microbial fermentation significantly affects the flavor and efficacy of tea. It is generally believed that fermented tea is more effective in lowering lipids, while unfermented tea can more effectively inhibit inflammation. However, there is not sufficient evidence to support this claim. To systematically compare the hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-atherosclerotic effects of tea before and after microbial fermentation, hyperlipidemic rats and inflammatory injury cells were treated with Monascus purpureus-fermented pu-erh tea water extract (MPT) and sun-dried green tea water extract (SGT), respectively.
   Results MPT, with higher levels of theabrownins, flavonoids, gallic acid (GA), and lovastatin, was more effective in reducing serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6), while SGT, with higher levels of tea polyphenols, amino acids, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and theaflavins, was more effective in increasing serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in hyperlipidemic rats. The foam cells on the arterial wall of the rats in the MPT group were visibly less, and the thrombosis time was longer than that in the SGT group. Cell experiments showed that MPT was more effective in protecting endothelial cells from damage than SGT.
   Conclusion Surprisingly, Monascus purpureus-fermented pu-erh tea not only had better hypolipidemic and anti-atherosclerotic effects than its raw material (sun-dried green tea), but also was superior in anti-inflammatory effects to the latter, which was possibly attributable to the great changes in functional ingredients during microbial fermentation.

AB Objective: The present study investigated the time needed to achieve a steady state for an accurate assessment of resting energy expenditure (REE) in adolescents with healthy weight and obesity. Materials and methods: Thirty adolescents aged 12-17 years were assigned to a group with healthy weight (GHW; n = 12, body mass index [BMI] 22.5 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2)) and another group with obesity (GO; n = 18, BMI 34.1 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2)). Participants underwent test-retest reliability of REE assessment as follows: a) 24 h of abstention from physical exercise, soft drinks, or caffeine; b) fasting for similar to 12 h; c) acclimation period of 10 min; d) 30-min assessment in a supine position. Results and discussion: A significant change occurred during the 30 min in REE. Significant differences existed between consecutive means until the 20th and 25th min for the GHW and GO, respectively. Although significant differences between trials 1 and 2 were detected during the first 5-10 min of assessment, the REE for each 5-min time point exhibited high test-retest reliability across trials in both groups (intraclass correlation coefficients range 0.79-0.99). Conclusion: The following recommendations are provided to promote accurate assessment of REE among adolescents: a) initiate the REE assessment with 10 min of acclimation to decrease restlessness; b) determine REE for a minimum of 20 min if healthy weight and 25 min if obesity; c) determine REE for a further 5 min, with the average of this last 5 min of REE data being regarded as the REE.

AB Tea is abundant in phytochemicals (such as polyphenols and theaflavins), which have a hypoglycemic effect. Previous studies investigating the relationship between tea consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have yielded inconsistent results. We hypothesized that tea consumption would be associated with a reduced risk of T2DM. This cohort study used data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, involving a total of 5199 participants initially recruited in 1997 and subsequently followed until 2009. Consumption of any variety of tea was tracked using structured questionnaires, and T2DM was diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association's criteria. We also performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE for publications through September 2021, including 19 cohort studies comprising 1,076,311 participants. In our cohort study, the logistic regression model showed a relative risk (RR) of T2DM among tea drinkers of 1.02 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-1.28) compared with non-tea drinkers. Although our updated meta-analysis showed no significant association between tea consumption and T2DM on the whole (pooled RR of 0.96 [0.91-1.00]), compared with the non-tea-drinking group, participants consuming 4 or more cups of tea per day had a 17% reduced risk of T2DM, with an RR of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90). These data support our hypothesis that tea consumption at higher doses (e.g., >= 4 cups/day) is associated with a reduced risk of T2DM.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary patterns and biochemical markers related to diabetes mellitus (DM): glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index from 35 454 Brazilian adolescents 12 to 17 y of age.Methods: Dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis by the principal components method. The data originated from the school-based study ERICA (Study of Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescents) carried out between 2013 and 2014. Linear regression models analyzed the associations.Results: Three dietary patterns were found: traditional Brazilian, bread and coffee, and Western. An inverse association was found in young girls between the traditional Brazilian pattern and fasting glucose (beta = -0.76; P = 0.005) and HbA1c in the second and third tertiles (beta = -0.04; P = 0.002; beta = -0 .06; P < 0.001), and the Western pattern with HbA1c (beta = -0.02; P = 0.035). In boys, a positive association was found between the second tertile of the dietary pattern and insulin (beta = 0.48; P = 0.009) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (beta = 0.11; P = 0.012).Conclusions: This study showed that the traditional Brazilian pattern was inversely associated with blood glucose and HbA1c values in girls. Furthermore, the data suggest that there is an important difference between boys and girls in the association of dietary patterns and the markers used.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Obesity and aging reduce skeletal muscle contractile function. However, it remains unclear whether obesity additively promotes muscle contractile dysfunction in the setting of aging. In this study. we investigated skeletal muscle contractile function ex vivo and intracellular Ca2+ release in male C57BL/6J mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 or 20 mo. Tetanic force production in the extensor digitorum longus muscle was decreased by aging or HFD feeding, and the further reduction was observed in aged HFD mice. The 20-mo HFD-fed mice, not the 20-mo LFD-fed mice or 4-mo HFD-fed mice, showed reduced intracellular Ca2+ peak levels by high concentration of caffeine (25 mM) compared with 4-mo LFD mice. Aging and HFD feeding additively increased intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) levels and were associated with the degree of impaired muscle contractile force and peak Ca2+ level. These data suggest that impairment in the contractile force in aged muscle is aggravated by HFD, which may be due, at least in part, to dysfunction in intracellular Ca2+ release. The IMCL, level may be a marker for impaired muscle contractile force caused by aging and HFD.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The aim of this study was to examine the effect of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity on contractile function and Ca2+ release capacity in aged skeletal muscle. Not only were the force production and peak Ca2+ levels decreased by aging and HFD feeding, respectively, but also, these interventions had an additive effect in aged HFD-fed mice. These data suggest that the impairment in the contractile force in aged muscle is aggravated by a HFD, which may be due to synergistic dysfunction in intracellular Ca2+ release.

AB Background The development of empirically-grounded policies to change the obesogenic nature of urban environment has been impeded by limited, inconclusive evidence of the link between food environments, dietary behaviors, and health-related outcomes, in part due to inconsistent methods of classifying and analyzing food environments. This study explores how individual and built environment characteristics may be associated with how far and long people travel to food venues,that can serve as a starting point for further policy-oriented research to develop a more nuanced, context-specific delineations of 'food environments' in an urban Asian context. Methods Five hundred twenty nine diners in eight different neighborhoods in Singapore were surveyed about how far and long they travelled to their meal venues, and by what mode. We then examined how respondents' food-related travel differed by socioeconomic characteristics, as well as objectively-measured built environment characteristics at travel origin and destination, using linear regression models. Results Low-income individuals expended more time traveling to meal destinations than high-income individuals, largely because they utilized slower modes like walking rather than driving. Those travelling from areas with high food outlet density travelled shorter distances and times than those from food-sparse areas, while those seeking meals away from their home and work anchor points had lower thresholds for travel. Respondents also travelled longer distances to food-dense locations, compared to food-sparse locations. Conclusion Those seeking to improve food environments of poor individuals should consider studying an intervention radius pegged to typical walking distances, or ways to improve their transport options as a starting point. Policy-focused research on food environments should also be sensitive to locational characteristics, such as food outlet densities and land use.

AB Objective: The relationship between combined healthy lifestyle and cardiovascular (CV) events in diabetes is unclear. We aim to investigate the association between a healthy lifestyle score (HLS) and the risk of mortality and CV events in diabetes.
   Methods: We examined the associations of six lifestyle factors scores (including healthy diet, moderate alcohol and regular coffee intakes, never smoking, physical activity, and normal weight) with diabetes in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study of 3,804 participants with diabetes from the United States at baseline. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and composite CV events (heart failure hospitalizations, myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, and stroke).
   Results: Among these diabetic participants, 1,881 (49.4%), 683 (18.0%), and 1,600 (42.0%) cases of all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and CV events were documented, respectively, during the 26 years of follow-up. Further, the prevalence of these adverse events became lower with the increase of HLS (all P < 0.001). In the risk-factors adjusted Cox regression model, compared to participants with HLS of 0, participants with HLS of 2 had significant lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.811, 95% CI: 0.687-0.957, P = 0.013), CV mortality (HR = 0.744, 95% CI: 0.576-0.962, P = 0.024), and CV events (HR = 0.789, 95% CI: 0.661-0.943, P = 0.009). The association of HLS with CV events was stronger for women than men (P for interaction <0.05).
   Conclusion: Adherence to a healthy lifestyle was associated with a lower risk of CV events and mortality in diabetics. Our findings suggest that the promotion of a healthy lifestyle would help reduce the increasing healthcare burden of diabetes.

AB Objective:
   The study sought to assess the influence of nutrition education and intervention programmes on nutrition knowledge and dietary practice among both students and staff (including faculty) of Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University in Saudi Arabia.
   Design:
   A pretest-posttest, non-randomised experimental study design was implemented at Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University in Riyadh City between September 2019 and February 2020.
   Setting:
   Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University is the largest women's university in the world and has eighteen colleges and institutions and around ninety academic programmes.
   Participants:
   The survey was completed by 1824 participants (1350 students and 474 staff/faculty) before the intervention and by a different cohort of 1731 participants (1317 students and 414 staff/faculty) after the intervention. In total, an independent sample of 3555 staff and students participated. Participants were asked about dietary knowledge and practices. Dietary knowledge entailed food variety and nutrients, fast food and its poor nutritional value, and the influence of cooking style on the nutritional quality of food. Dietary practices involved eating breakfast; consuming salt/sugar, eating high-salt food; eating pre-packaged food and consumption of vegetables, fruits, supplements, water and caffeine.
   Results:
   The majority of the sample consisted of students (75 center dot 1 %) and had not been diagnosed with any disease (73 center dot 7 %). The result of the current study showed that nutrition knowledge improved after completion of the nutrition programme.
   Conclusions:
   The nutrition awareness programme improved students' nutritional knowledge; however, there was no significant effect on their dietary practices. Future nutrition awareness programmes should separate activities for students and staff, focusing on one target population at a time.

AB No Money No Time (NMNT) is a culinary nutrition website designed to optimize diet quality. The primary aim was to evaluate the impact of an online targeted nutrition challenge email campaign that encouraged engagement with NMNT and goal setting to improve diet quality and weekly food expenditure. A secondary aim was to assess NMNT engagement. Australian adults >= 18 years were recruited to the eHealth nutrition challenge delivered via weekly emails. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Quiz (HEQ) diet quality tool. Engagement was assessed using email open and click-through rates. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was conducted using mixed effects linear regression. Of 481 adults (49.7 +/- 13.9 years, 84% female) who enrolled 79 (16%) completed the challenge. ITT results indicated statistically significant 6-week increases in diet quality score (+3.8 points p <= 0.001, d = 0.58) with sub-scale improvements in vegetables (+0.9 points, p = 0.01, d = 0.32), fruit (+1.2 points, p <= 0.001, d = 0.55), and dairy (+0.9 points, p <= 0.001, d = 0.58). There were significant post-challenge reductions in household spending on takeaway/snacks/coffee of AUD 8.9 per week (p = 0.01, d = 0.29), body weight reduction (-0.6 kg, p = 0.03, d = 0.26), and BMI (-0.2 kg/m2 p = 0.02, d = 0.28). The email open rate remained constant at around 67% (56% to 75%), with an average click-through rate of 18% (7.1% to 37.9%). The eHealth nutrition challenge significantly improved diet quality while reducing BMI and money spent on discretionary foods. Strategies to scale the challenge should be tested as an innovative population strategy for improving diet quality, health indicators, and managing household food budgets.

AB Young adults are frequent consumers of food prepared outside the home (FOH). In a cross-sectional survey, the MYMeals study, we showed FOH provided one-third of meals and snacks for young Australian adults, yet it contributed higher proportions of energy and nutrients of concern, such as saturated fat and sodium. This study aimed to determine the detailed proportional contribution of nutrients of concern from the nine food outlet types captured in the MYMeals study. Young adults residing in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, (n = 1001) used a validated smartphone app to report all types and amounts of food and beverages consumed for three consecutive days, as well as their preparation location. The proportions of daily energy, macronutrients, sodium, total sugars, and saturated fat were calculated for each of the nine following outlet types: bakeries or patisseries, coffee chains, cold-drink chains, fast-food chains, ice creamery or frozen yoghurt outlets, independent cafes or restaurants, pubs (hotels) and clubs, service stations or convenience stores, and others not fitting the above categories. Of all FOH outlet types, independent cafes or restaurants contributed the most energy (17.5%), sodium (20.0%) and saturated fat (17.8%) to the total diet, followed by fast-food chains (12.0% energy, 15.8% sodium, and 12.0% saturated fat) and other outlets, with smaller proportions. For males, the proportion of energy and nutrients contributed by fast-food outlets was higher than for females (14.8% versus 9.8% energy). Menu labelling at independent cafes and restaurants is recommended, comprising, in addition to the energy labels already in use in fast-food restaurants, the labelling of nutrients of concern. The feasibility of this recommendation warrants further exploration.

AB The anti-obesity activity of the bioactive fractions of Haldina cordifolia (HC) was investigated in pursuit of a novel herbal plant targeting obesity, as its anti-obesity potential has not yet been investigated. This innovative study examined the HC bioactive fraction to select the most significant fraction using an array of studies targeting obesity. Initially, a quantitative phytochemical assessment including total phenolic, flavonoid, and steroidal contents was performed. Additionally, a series of in vitro antioxidant ABTS, DPPH, nitric oxide, and hydrogen peroxide scavenging assays were implemented, whereas, alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and pancreatic lipase assays were conducted for the inhibition of enzyme capabilities. The findings demonstrated that fractions F2 and F3 have better efficacy, based on IC50 values. Subsequently, the anti-obesity potential of fractions was assessed utilizing cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, oil red O staining, and triglyceride content, as markers of accumulation of lipid which showed significant results. Furthermore, high-performance thin-layer chromatography-multistage mass spectrometry (HPTLC-MSn) was employed to identify the phytoconstituents within these fractions, particularly the anti-obesity agent, beta-sitosterol. HPTLC-MSn analysis revealed the presence of five major compounds in fraction F2: caffeine, quercetin, beta-sitosterol naringin, and ascorbic acid along with retro Diels-Alder fragmentation. Finally, an in silico study was designed which subsequently established the optimal binding activity of the obtained compounds towards the particular receptors targeting obesity. Overall, fraction F2 showed the most potent activity. The study unveiled the promising anti-obesity potential of bioactive fractions from HC and a potential treatment strategy has been established to combat obesity.

So far, hundreds of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with handgrip strength, lean mass and walking pace have been identified in the UK Biobank cohort; however, their pleiotropic effects on all three phenotypes have not been investigated. By combining summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of handgrip strength, lean mass and walking pace, we have identified 78 independent SNPs (from 73 loci) associated with all three traits with consistent effect directions. Of the 78 SNPs, 55 polymorphisms were also associated with body fat percentage and 25 polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes (T2D), indicating that sarcopenia, obesity and T2D share many common risk alleles. Follow-up bioinformatic analysis revealed that sarcopenia risk alleles were associated with tiredness, falls in the last year, neuroticism, alcohol intake frequency, smoking, time spent watching television, higher salt, white bread, and processed meat intake; whereas protective alleles were positively associated with bone mineral density, serum testosterone, IGF1, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, height, intelligence, cognitive performance, educational attainment, income, physical activity, ground coffee drinking and healthier diet (muesli, cereal, wholemeal or wholegrain bread, potassium, magnesium, cheese, oily fish, protein, water, fruit, and vegetable intake). Furthermore, the literature data suggest that single-bout resistance exercise may induce significant changes in the expression of 26 of the 73 implicated genes in m. vastus lateralis, which may partly explain beneficial effects of strength training in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. In conclusion, we have identified and characterized 78 SNPs associated with sarcopenia and 55 SNPs with sarcopenic obesity in European-ancestry individuals from the UK Biobank.

AB OBJECTIVES: To identify dietary patterns among Brazilian adults based on the National Dietary Surveys (INA - Inqueritos Nacionais de Alimentacao) in 2008-2009 and 2017-2018, and to verify in the second period the adherence to the patterns according to sociodemographic factors and Brazilian regions.
   METHODS: We analyzed the first of two days of adults' food consumption (19-59 years) in INA data from 2008-2009 (n = 21,630) and 2017-2018 (n = 28,901). Dietary patterns were derived by exploratory factor analysis from 19 food groups, considering the complexity of the sample design. We evaluated the factor scores according to sex, age group, region, per capita income, and education for the INA data in 2017-2018.
   RESULTS: We identified three patterns in the two surveys: (1) "traditional", characterized by rice, beans, and meat; (2) "breads and butter/margarine", characterized by breads, oils, and fats (including margarine/butter) and, coffee and teas in 2008-2009; and (3) "western", characterized by sodas, pizzas, snacks, flour, pasta, and sweets in 2017-2018. The "traditional" pattern had greater adherence among men, residents of the Midwest region and individuals with incomplete primary education. "Bread and butter/margarine" pattern had greater adherence among males, individuals aged between 40 and 59 years, from the Southeast region, and with income between 1 and 2 minimum wages per capita. Male individuals, aged between 19 and 39 years, from the South region, with per capita income greater than two minimum wages, and education level equal to or greater than primary education showed greater adherence to the "western" pattern.
   CONCLUSION: The dietary patterns identified in 2008-2009 and 2017-2018 were similar, and we observed the maintenance of the "traditional" pattern, which includes rice, beans, and meat. Adherence to the dietary patterns varies according to sex, age group, region, per capita income, and education level.

AB Studies indicate that eating locations can influence food choices. However, the relationship with ultra-processed foods has been little explored. The objective was to assess the association between eating locations and ultra-processed foods consumption in the UK in 2014-2016. Data from 2,449 individuals aged 4 years or older from the NDNS were analysed cross-sectionally. Food consumption information was collected through 4-day food diaries. Recorded foods were classified into NOVA system. The eating locations were grouped into nine categories (home, institutional places, sit-down restaurants, on the go, coffee shops, leisure and sports clubs, fast food, friends and relatives' house, and other places). Linear regression models were carried out. The coefficients represent the increment in the contribution of ultra-processed foods to total energy intake for each percentage point increase in the contribution of each eating location to total energy intake. Among children, consumption at home was inversely associated with ultra-processed foods consumption (beta: -0.10; 95% CI -0.17, -0.03), while in leisure and sports places (0.47; 0.20, 0.73) directly associated. For adolescents, eating at home (-0.12; -0.19, -0.05) was inversely associated with the consumption of ultra-processed foods, as well as sit-down restaurants (-0.21; -0.38, -0.03). Fast food (0.29; 0.12, 0.47) were directly associated with the consumption of ultra-processed foods for adolescents. Finally, for adults, sit-down restaurants (-0.13; -0.22, -0.03) showed to be inversely associated with the consumption of ultra-processed foods while in fast food restaurants (0.77; 0.38, 1.17) it was directly associated. Our results showed that the eating locations have different impacts on diet quality.

AB BackgroundMetabolic syndrome (MetS) is one of the main public health problems worldwide. Although some relations between dietary intakes and MetS have been found, few studies have focused on association between dietary nutrients interactions and the risk of the MetS and its components. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between nutrient patterns and MetS and its components among Iranian adult population.MethodsA total of 588 subjects (aged 18-64years, 271 males and 317 females) enrolled in the cross sectional study. Dietary consumption was evaluated using an 80-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Biochemical assessments including fasting blood sugar (FBS), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT) and serum lipids were performed by enzymatic methods. Nutrient patterns were obtained by factor analysis procedure using principal component method. Multinational logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between nutrient patterns and MetS and its components.ResultsThree nutrient patterns explaining 53.66% of the variance in dietary nutrients intake, were recognized in the current study. Animal-sourced nutrient pattern was significantly associated with the higher odds of MetS and high triglyceride (TG) levels. Plant-sourced nutrient pattern (high intake of fiber, carbohydrate, vitamins B-6, B-3, C, B-1, E, D, magnesium, potassium, and linoleic acid) was significantly associated with lower risk of MetS and lower blood pressure (p<0.05). Third nutrient pattern (mixed-source) was significantly related to higher risk of MetS, high waist circumference (WC) and high systolic blood pressure (SBP).ConclusionThis present study confirms the important effect of nutrients and their patterns on MetS risk. Our results suggest that adherence to the nutrient pattern rich in fiber, carbohydrate, vitamins D, B-6, B-3, C, B-1, E, magnesium, potassium, linoleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is associated with a lower risk of MetS, while animal- and mixed-sourced nutrient patterns are positively associated with greater odds of MetS; However, further longitudinal and interventional studies are required to make a clear conclusion.

AB PurposeTo identify the dietary patterns and their association with cardiovascular risk factors among adult people in urban and rural areas of Wolaita, southern Ethiopia. MethodsA total of 2,483 participants aged 25-64 years were selected using a three-stage random sampling. Data for this study were collected using structured questionnaires, the previous 24-h dietary intake assessment, anthropometric, blood pressure, and biochemical measurements. We used factor analysis to identify dietary patterns. Factors associated with dietary patterns were analyzed using multiple linear regression models. The adjusted regression coefficients with their 95% CI were used to ascertain the association. ResultWe identified three major dietary patterns that explained 51% of the variance in food consumption. The western dietary pattern was characterized by the consumption of meat/organ meat, biscuits/sweets, chicken stew, pasta-macaroni recipes, butter, white wheat bread, egg recipe, and Ethiopian dish shiro-wet, and was positively associated with urban residence, obesity, hypertension, blood glucose, and total cholesterol levels. Adherence to the consumption of tubers, whole-grain maize products, coffee leaves-and-herbs beverage, legumes, and sweet potatoes featured the traditional dietary pattern. The traditional dietary pattern showed a positive relationship with rural residence, physical activity, and obesity, and it had a negative relationship with hypertension. The healthy dietary pattern was characterized by the intake of green leafy vegetables, green pepper, and whole-grain maize products, and negatively related to obesity, and hypertension, while positively related to urban residence. ConclusionThe coexistence of western, traditional, and healthy dietary patterns in the present study indicates the transition to a new dietary pattern in the study area. All dietary patterns were associated with one or more cardiovascular risk factors, but the western dietary pattern was associated with most of these, while the traditional diet showed fewer such associations. Therefore, it might be useful to promote healthy and traditional dietary patterns along with physical activity. Interventions related to the current findings, if initiated early in life, may benefit the public in preventing cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, and type 2-diabetes.

AB The potential ability of nutritional compounds to induce or enhance the browning of adipocytes has attracted large interest as a workable means of combatting the obesity epidemic. Green tea compounds are discussed as such inducers of an enhanced thermogenic capacity and activity. However, the cell-autonomous effects of green tea compounds on adipocytes have until now only been demonstrated in adipogenic cell lines (3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A), i.e., cells of undefined tissue lineage. In this study, we examine the ability of green tea compounds to cell-autonomously induce thermogenic recruitment in authentic brown and brite/beige adipocytes in vitro. In primary brown adipocytes, the green tea compounds suppressed basal UCP1 gene expression, and there was no positive interaction between the compounds and adrenergic stimulation. In white adipocytes, green tea compounds decreased both basal and norepinephrine-induced UCP1 mRNA levels, and this was associated with the suppression of cell differentiation, indicated by reduced lipogenic gene expression and lipid accumulation. A lack of interaction between rosiglitazone and green tea compounds suggests that the green tea compounds do not directly interact with the PPAR gamma pathway. We conclude that there is a negative effect of the green tea compounds on basal UCP1 gene expression, in both brown and white primary adipocytes, in contrast to the positive effects earlier reported from studies in adipogenic cell lines. We posit that the epigenetic status of the adipogenic cell lines is fundamentally different from that of genuine brown and white adipocytes, reflected, e.g., in several-thousand-fold differences in UCP1 gene expression levels. Thus, results obtained with adipogenic cell lines cannot unreservedly be extrapolated as being relevant for authentic effects in brown and white adipocytes. We suggest that this conclusion can be of general concern for studies attempting to establish physiologically relevant cell-autonomous effects.

AB Background: Animal experiments have found that oil tea reduces body weight and improves blood lipid levels. However, the effect of oil tea on human health has not been confirmed yet. This study aims to explore the relationship between oil tea consumption and obesity and dyslipidemia.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional population study in Guangxi, China, a semi-quantitative questionnaire was used to investigate the oil tea consumed and food consumption frequency in adults aged 30 years and over. Anthropometric variables and serum biochemical indicators were measured. A total of 2001 adults were divided into five groups based on their non-consumption status and quartile of consumption (groups non-drink oil tea, Q1-Q4).
   Results: The risk of abdominal obesity tended to decrease significantly with increasing consumption of oil tea (P for trend<0.05) in the overall participants (Q3 group, OR = 0.545, 95% CI = 0.336-0.884; Q4 group, OR = 0.520, 95% CI = 0.311-0.871) and in women (Q2 group, OR = 0.502, 95% CI = 0.274-0.920; Q3 group, OR = 0.397, 95% CI = 0.213-0.740; Q4 group, OR = 0.421, 95% CI = 0.228-0.780). Oil tea consumption Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 group significantly reduced the risk of abnormal HDL-cholesterol (P < 0.05). Oil tea consumption Q2 group significantly increased the risk of abnormal LDL-cholesterol (OR = 2.600, 95% CI = 1.033-6.546) in women. Oil tea consumption Q1 (OR = 0.081, 95% CI=0.008-0.864) and Q3 (OR = 0.057, 95% CI = 0.004-0.913) groups significantly reduced the risk of abnormal HDL-cholesterol in women.
   Conclusion: Oil tea consumption may be associated with a low risk of abdominal obesity. High-dose oil tea consumption may be associated with a low risk of abnormal HDL-cholesterol. Prospective studies with large sample sizes would be required to further investigate this association.

AB The leaves of Ilex paraguariensis (known as Yerba mate), used as a popular beverage, are a very well-recognized plant material with various biological activities, including analeptic (because of caffeine), anti-obesity (phenolics, saponins), antimicrobial, and antiviral (phenolics, saponins). Here, the chemical compositions of the leaves of two European Ilex species (x meserveae and aquifolium) with three varieties each were investigated. The terpenoid, saponin, and polyphenolic fractions were submitted for LC-MS or GC-MS analysis against a standard Mate leaf. In addition, the aroma profiles of all the species were analysed using HS-SPME-Arrow prior to GC-MS analysis. All fractions were subjected to antiviral and cytotoxic assays. We found 86 compounds in all accessions, with limonene, linalool, and p-cymene being predominant. There were minor similarities between the volatile compositions of the European and South American species. We found ursolic and oleanolic acid to be the main compounds in the terpenoid fraction. Mono-caffeoylquinic acids and di-caffeoylquinic acids were the main constituents of the polar fractions. About 180 compounds from the saponin group were tentatively identified, of which 9 and 3 were selected as distinctive markers for I. meserveae and I. aquifolium, respectively. Based on chemical screening, I. aquifolium Silver Queen was chosen as the source of terpenoid and saponin fractions and polyphenol extracts. The most substantial inhibition of cancer cell growth was observed with saponin in the case of the MCF7 (human breast cancer) cell line, while for LoVo and L929 cell lines (human colorectal cancer and reference mouse fibroblasts), it was slightly weaker. These results should be analysed further as a promising chemoprevention of colorectal and gastrointestinal cancers. Saponin and polyphenolic extracts exhibited similar activities against HSV-1 and HAdV-5, with 4-log reduction in virus titres. This study focuses our attention on a field of potential antiviral formulations derived from European holly.

AB Background Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia play important roles in the progression of multiple chronic disease and conditions. Diet modulates insulin response; however, evidence is limited regarding whether diets with higher insulinemic potential increase the risk of invasive breast cancer. Objectives We aimed to prospectively evaluate the association between a food-based empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH) and the incidence of invasive breast cancer. Methods We prospectively followed 76,686 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1984-2016) and 93,287 women from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII; 1991-2017). Diet was assessed by food-frequency questionnaires every 4 y. The insulinemic potential of diet was evaluated using the previously established EDIH based on circulating C-peptide concentrations. Higher scores indicate higher insulinemic potential of the diet. Covariates included reproductive, hormonal, and anthropometric factors (height and BMI at age 18 y); race; socioeconomic status; total alcohol intake; total caloric intake; and physical activity. Results During 4,216,106 person-years of follow-up, we documented 10,602 breast cancer cases (6689 NHS, 3913 NHSII). In the pooled multivariable-adjusted analyses, women in the highest, compared with the lowest, EDIH quintile (Q) were at higher breast cancer risk (HRQ5 vs. Q1 = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.24; P-trend < 0.01). Although heterogeneity by estrogen receptor (ER) status was nonsignificant, the strongest association between EDIH and breast cancer was observed for ER-negative tumors (HRQ5 vs. Q1 = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.46; P-trend = 0.02). Among tumor molecular subtypes, the strongest associations were observed for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched tumors (HRQ5 vs. Q1 = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.61; P-trend = 0.02). Conclusions A dietary pattern contributing to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance was associated with greater breast cancer risk, especially ER-negative and HER2-enriched tumors. Our findings suggest that dietary modifications to reduce insulinemic potential may reduce the risk of breast cancer.

AB Background Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) remains a world epidemic. Obtaining accurate estimates of its incidence and their predictors will aid in targeting preventive measures, allocating resources, and strategizing its management. The Middle East North Africa region has high T2D prevalence and rates of rise. Few incidence studies exist for the region, and none from Lebanon. The current study objective was to determine diabetes incidence and diabetes predictors in a community-based Lebanese sample. A secondary objective was to describe the metabolic control over time in adults with preexisting diabetes. Methods This is a five-year (2014-2019) follow-up study on a random sample of 501 residents of the Greater Beirut area. Out of 478 people eligible to participate in the follow-up study, 198 returned (response rate 39.5%). Assessment included medical history, anthropometric measures, food frequency, sleep, and lifestyle questionnaires. Laboratory data included glycemic indices (fasting glucose and HbA1C) and other biological markers. The diagnosis of probable diabetes (PD) was based on one abnormal test for either fasting glucose >= 126 mg/dL or HbA1C >= 6.5% or having history of diabetes. Results The incidence of diabetes was 17.2 (95% CI 9.6-28.7) per 1000 person-years. Cardiometabolic risk factors independently associated with diabetes were: older age, higher BMI, family history of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, higher CRP and triglyceride level; whereas an independent predictor of diabetes was previous BMI. In addition, the 42 participants with preexisting diabetes had worsening of their metabolic profile over a five-year period. Conclusions The incidence of diabetes was high as compared to some reported world rates, and in line with the high prevalence in the MENA region. The risk was highest in those with positive family history and the presence of the metabolic syndrome or its components. Preventive measures should particularly target participants with that specific risk profile. This becomes particularly important when observing that metabolic control gets worse over time in individuals with diabetes.

AB Over one third of Australians' daily energy intake is from discretionary foods and drinks. While many health promotion efforts seek to limit discretionary food intake, the population health impact of reductions in the consumption of different types of discretionary foods (e.g., sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), confectionery, sweet biscuits) has not been quantified. This study estimated the potential reductions in body weight, obesity-related disease incidence, and healthcare cost savings associated with consumption of one less serving per week of different discretionary foods. Reductions in the different types of discretionary food were modelled individually to estimate the impact on energy consumption and population body weight by 5-year age and sex groups. It was assumed that one serving of discretionary food each week was replaced with either a serving of fruit or popcorn, and a serving (375 mL) of SSBs was replaced with coffee, tea, or milk. Proportional multi-state multiple-cohort Markov modelling estimated likely resultant health adjusted life years (HALYs) gained and healthcare costs saved over the lifetime of the 2010 Australian population. A reduction of one serving of SSBs (375 mL) had the greatest potential impact in terms of weight reduction, particularly in ages 19-24 years (mean 0.31 kg, 95% UI: 0.23 kg to 0.37 kg) and overall healthcare cost savings of AUD 793.4 million (95% UI: 589.1 M to 976.1 M). A decrease of one serving of sweet biscuits had the second largest potential impact on weight change overall, with healthcare cost savings of $640.7 M (95% CI: $402.6 M to $885.8 M) and the largest potential weight reduction amongst those aged 75 years and over (mean 0.21 kg, 95% UI: 0.14 kg to 0.27 kg). The results demonstrate that small reductions in discretionary food consumption are likely to have substantial health benefits at the population level. Moreover, the study highlights that policy responses to improve population diets may need to be tailored to target different types of foods for different population groups.

AB Background and aims: The current work aimed to identify the predominant correlates of prediabetes and T2DM among a variety of socio-demographic, anthropometric and lifestyle indices, in a large sample of adults from families at high risk for T2DM.
   Methods and results: In this cross-sectional study, 2816 adults were recruited from low-socioeconomic areas in high-income countries (HICs) (Belgium-Finland), HICs under austerity measures (Greece-Spain), and low/middle-income countries (LMICs) (Bulgaria-Hungary). A positive association between the male sex (OR, 95% C.I.2.77 (1.69-4.54)) and prediabetes was revealed compared to females, while there was a negative association between younger age (<45 years) (OR, 95% C.I. 0.58 (0.37-0.92)), and low/medium levels of waist circumference (OR, 95% Cl. 0.44 (0.22-0.89)) with prediabetes compared to older age and high levels of waist circumference, respectively. Concerning T2DM, 0-0.5 cups/day of fruits and berries (OR, 95% C.I.2. 13 (1.16-3.91)) and 150-300 g fish/week (OR, 95% C.I. 2.55 (1.01-6.41)) have a positive association compared to higher consumptions, respectively. Conversely, <1 cup/week legumes (OR, 95% C.I. 0.55 (0.31-0.99) as well as 0-0.5 servings (OR, 95% CI. 0.34 (0.12-0.95) and 0.5-1 servings (OR, 95% CI. 0.37 (0.19-0.71) of full-fat dairy/day have a negative association compared to higher consumptions, respectively.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate the need for diabetes prevention measures targeting young adults and especially men, above 45 years of age, with central obesity and poor dietary habits and prioritize vulnerable groups and populations living in LMICs.

AB Background: Despite the associations between individual nutrients and sarcopenia, we are aware of no information about the link between patterns of nutrient intake and odds of sarcopenia and its components. The present study aimed to examine the association between nutrient-based dietary patterns and sarcopenia and its components among the Iranian adult population.
   Methods: In this population-based, cross-sectional study, we enrolled 300 elderly adults (150 men and 150 women) aged >= 55 years by using a cluster random sampling method. Dietary intakes of the study population were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Principal component analysis was conducted to derive nutrient patterns based on a daily intake of 33 nutrients. Muscle mass, muscle strength, and gait speed were measured according to standard methods. Sarcopenia and its components were defined based on the European Working Group on Sarcopenia.
   Results: Three major nutrient-based dietary patterns were identified: (1) the "pro-vit pattern" that was high in pantothenic (B5), cobalamin (B12), calcium, protein, phosphor, riboflavin (B2), zinc, cholesterol, saturated fat, folate, niacin (B3), selenium, vitamin D, vitamin K, and vitamin A; (2) the "anti-inflammatory" pattern, which was rich in polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, copper, vitamin E, omega-3, magnesium, iron, pyridoxine (B6), sodium, and caffeine; and (3) the "carbo-vit" patternm which is characterized by high intake of fructose, glucose, dietary fiber, biotin, potassium, thiamin (B1), vitamin C, and chromium. After adjusting for confounders, subjects in the top tertile of the anti-inflammatory pattern had lower odds of sarcopenia (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.10-0.63) and low muscle strength (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.22-0.96) than those in the bottom tertile. Greater adherence to the carbo-vit pattern was inversely associated with the odds of low gait speed (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.235-0.93).
   Conclusion: Major nutrient-based dietary patterns were significantly associated with sarcopenia and its components. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.

AB Background: Quercetin is a natural flavonoid, which widely exists in nature, such as tea, coffee, apples, and onions. Numerous studies have showed that quercetin has multiple biological activities such as anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging. Hence, quercetin has a significant therapeutic effect on cancers, obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. In the past decades, a large number of studies have shown that quercetin combined with other agents can significantly improve the overall therapeutic effect, compared to single use.
   Purpose: This work reviews the pharmacological activities of quercetin and its derivatives. In addition, this work also summarizes both in vivo and in vitro experimental evidence for the synergistic effect of quercetin against cancers and metabolic diseases.
   Methods: An extensive systematic search for pharmacological activities and synergistic effect of quercetin was performed considering all the relevant literatures published until August 2021 through the databases including NCBI PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The relevant literatures were extracted from the databases with following keyword combinations: "pharmacological activities" OR "biological activities" OR "synergistic effect" OR "combined" OR "combination" AND "quercetin" as well as free-text words.
   Results: Quercetin and its derivatives possess multiple pharmacological activities including anti-cancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cardiovascular, anti-aging, and neuroprotective activities. In addition, the synergistic effect of quercetin with small molecule agents against cancers and metabolic diseases has also been confirmed.
   Conclusion: Quercetin cooperates with agents to improve the therapeutic effect by regulating signal molecules and blocking cell cycle. Synergistic therapy can reduce the dose of agents and avoid the possible toxic and side effects in the treatment process. Although quercetin treatment has some potential side effects, it is safe under the expected use conditions. Hence, quercetin has application value and potential strength as a clinical drug. Furthermore, quercetin, as the main effective therapeutic ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, may effectively treat and prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

AB BackgroundObesity and chronic diseases are significant public health issues in the Middle East and North Africa region. A robust body of evidence demonstrated the association between beverage consumption, obesity, and chronic diseases. Therefore, the assessment of beverage consumption is gaining more interest in health policy development, food industry partnerships, research expansion and community involvement. Although beverage-consumption assessment tools have been developed for various populations, none were developed for the Arabic population. In this study, we developed and validated an online Arabic Beverage Frequency Questionnaire (ABFQ) to assess the total beverage intake among Arabic speaking population.MethodsA cross-sectional validation study was conducted among healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 years. Participants (n = 49) completed a 24-item ABFQ on two occasions and provided one 24-h urine sample. For validity, total beverage consumption (ABFQ1) was assessed against a 24-h urine sample using an osmolality test and correlation analysis. Reliability was assessed by comparing the participants' consumption in total and for every 24 individual items from ABFQ1 with the total and individual items in ABFQ2 using correlation and paired sample t-test.ResultsThe average daily consumption of beverages was 1504 ml/day, while the average urine osmolality/kg was 614. The validity assessment between ABFQ and urine osmolality indicates a negative correlation. However, the correlation was week and not statistically significant (r(s) = -0.2, p = 0.12). In reliability test, correlation analysis was positive and acceptable in all beverage categories (r(s) = 0.4 - 0.9; all p < 0.05) except flavored milk (r(s) = 0.2; p < 0.181) and sweetened coffee (r(s) = 0.3; p < 0.022). Furthermore, no significant differences were found between the means of total consumption in both ABFQ1 and ABFQ2.ConclusionsThe finding of this study suggest that the ABFQ is a reliable reproducible tool for assessing beverage consumption among Arabic-speaking consumers. However, the survey could not be validated using 24-h urine osmolality only and other methods such as multi dietary records may use in future re-assessment.

AB Background: Sodium-glucose linked transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibition has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in heart failure independently of glycemic control and prevents the onset of atrial arrhythmias, a common co-morbidity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The mechanism behind these effects is not fully understood, and it remains unclear if they could be further enhanced by additional SGLT-1 inhibition. We investigated the effects of chronic treatment with the dual SGLT-1&2 inhibitor sotagliflozin on left atrial (LA) remodeling and cellular arrhythmogenesis (i.e. atrial cardiomyopathy) in a metabolic syndrome-related rat model of HFpEF.
   Methods: 17 week-old ZSF-1 obese rats, a metabolic syndrome-related model of HFpEF, and wild type rats (Wistar Kyoto), were fed 30 mg/kg/d sotagliflozin for 6 weeks. At 23 weeks, LA were imaged in-vivo by echocardiography. In-vitro, Ca2+ transients (CaT; electrically stimulated, caffeine-induced) and spontaneous Ca2+ release were recorded by ratiometric microscopy using Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes (Fura-2) during various experimental protocols. Mitochondrial structure (dye: Mitotracker), Ca2+ buffer capacity (dye: Rhod-2), mitochondrial depolarization (dye: TMRE) and production of reactive oxygen species (dye: H2DCF) were visualized by confocal microscopy. Statistical analysis was performed with 2-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Bonferroni and student's t-test, as applicable.
   Results: Sotagliflozin ameliorated LA enlargement in HFpEF in-vivo. In-vitro, LA cardiomyocytes in HFpEF showed an increased incidence and amplitude of arrhythmic spontaneous Ca2+ release events (SCaEs). Sotagliflozin significantly reduced the magnitude of SCaEs, while their frequency was unaffected. Sotagliflozin lowered diastolic [Ca2+] of CaT at baseline and in response to glucose influx, possibly related to a similar to 50% increase of sodium sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) forward-mode activity. Sotagliflozin prevented mitochondrial swelling and enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ buffer capacity in HFpEF. Sotagliflozin improved mitochondrial fission and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during glucose starvation and averted Ca2+ accumulation upon glycolytic inhibition.
   Conclusion: The SGLT-1&2 inhibitor sotagliflozin ameliorated LA remodeling in metabolic HFpEF. It also improved distinct features of Ca2+-mediated cellular arrhythmogenesis in-vitro (i.e. magnitude of SCaEs, mitochondrial Ca2+ buffer capacity, diastolic Ca2+ accumulation, NCX activity). The safety and efficacy of combined SGLT-1&2 inhibition for the treatment and/or prevention of atrial cardiomyopathy associated arrhythmias should be further evaluated in clinical trials.

ID STRESS
AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered stress, anxiety, and disruption to many individuals' daily lives, which might impact eating habits. Objective: To examine changes in eating habits related to less healthy foods and beverages during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic among US adults. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants/setting: Authors used SummerStyles data gathered in June 2020 among 3916 US adults (>= 18 years). Main outcome measures: The outcome of interest was the reported frequency of consuming more (1) unhealthy snacks and desserts including chips, cookies, and ice cream and (2) sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) like regular soda, fruit drinks, sports/energy drinks, sweetened coffee/teas during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses were categorized as Never/Rarely, Sometimes, or Often/Always. Explanatory variables were sociodemographics, weight status, and census regions. Statistical analyses performed: We used multinomial regressions to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for Sometimes or Often/Always consuming more unhealthy snacks/desserts (vs. Never/Rarely); and Sometimes or Often/Always more SSBs (vs. Never/Rarely). Results: Overall, 36% of adults reported sometimes consuming more unhealthy snacks/desserts; 16% did so often/always. Twenty-two percent of adults reported sometimes drinking more SSBs; 10% did so often/always. Factors significantly associated with higher odds of reporting often/always consuming more unhealthy snacks/desserts were younger adults (AOR range = 1.51-2.86 vs. adults >= 65 years), females (AOR = 1.58 vs. males), non-Hispanic Black (AOR = 1.89 vs. non-Hispanic White), lower household income (AOR = 2.01 for <USD 35,000 vs. >= USD 100,000), and obesity (AOR = 1.56 vs. underweight/healthy weight). Factors significantly associated with odds of Often/Always drinking more SSBs were being younger (AOR range = 2.26-4.39 vs. adults >= 65 years), non-Hispanic Black (AOR = 3.25 vs. non-Hispanic White), Hispanic (AOR = 1.75 vs. non-Hispanic White), non-Hispanic Other race/ethnicity (AOR = 2.41 vs. non-Hispanic White), lower education (AOR = 2.03 for <= high school; AOR = 1.80 for some college vs. college graduate), lower household income (AOR range = 1.64-3.15 vs. >= USD 100,000), and obesity (AOR = 1.61 vs. underweight/healthy weight). Conclusions: Consuming more sugary foods and SSBs during the first phase of the pandemic was higher in younger adults, lower-income adults, people of racial/ethnic minority groups, and adults with obesity. Dietary shifts to less healthy foods and drinks may influence metabolic health if sustained long-term. Implementing strategies to support individual's healthy eating habits during the ongoing pandemic and the pandemic recovery may benefit health and wellness.
