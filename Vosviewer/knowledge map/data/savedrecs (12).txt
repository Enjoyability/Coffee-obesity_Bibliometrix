AB OBJECTIVE - Coffee consumption has been associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the acute effects of decaffeinated coffee and the major coffee components chlorogenic acid and trigonelline on glucose tolerance.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We conducted a randomized crossover trial of the effects of 12 g decaffeinated coffee, 1 g chlorogenic acid, 500 mg trigonelline, and placebo (1 g mannitol) on glucose and insulin concentrations during a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 15 overweight men.
   RESULTS - Chlorogenic acid and trigonelline ingestion significantly reduced glucose (-0.7 mmol/l, P = 0.007, and -0.5 mmol/l, P = 0.024, respectively) and insulin (-73 pmol/l, P = 0.038, and -117 pmol/l, P = 0.007) concentrations 15 min following an OGTT compared with placebo. None of the treatments affected insulin or glucose area under the curve values during the OGTT compared with placebo.
   CONCLUSIONS - Chlorogenic acid and trigonelline reduced early glucose and insulin responses during an OGTT. Diabetes Care 32:1.023-1025, 2009

AB The results from a clinical study performed in 12 healthy volunteers with different coffee products containing glucose show that instant coffee enriched with chlorogenic acid induced a reduction in the absorption of glucose of 6.9% compared with the control. No such effects were seen with normal or decaffeinated instant coffee. In a second, comparative, randomized, double-blind, 12-week study we investigated the effect on the body mass of 30 overweight people, compared with normal instant coffee. The average losses in mass in the chlorogenic acid enriched and normal instant coffee groups were 5.4 and 1.7 kg, respectively. We conclude that chlorogenic acid enriched instant coffee appears to have a significant effect on the absorption and utilization of glucose from the diet. This effect, if the coffee is used for an extended time, may result in reduced body mass and body fat when compared with the use of normal instant coffee.

   HUMANS
AB Recent prospective epidemiology links heavy coffee consumption to a substantial reduction in risk for type 2 diabetes. Yet there is no evidence that coffee improves insulin sensitivity and, at least in acute studies, caffeine has a negative impact in this regard. Thus, it is reasonable to suspect that coffee influences the risk for beta cell "failure" that precipitates diabetes in subjects who are already insulin resistant. Indeed, there is recent evidence that coffee increases production of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), possibly owing to an inhibitory effect of chlorogenic acid (CGA - the chief polyphenol in coffee) on glucose absorption. GLP-1 acts on beta cells, via cAMP-dependent mechanisms, to promote the synthesis and activity of the transcription factor IDX-1, crucial for maintaining the responsiveness of beta cells to an increase in plasma glucose. Conversely, the "glucolipotoxicity" thought to initiate and sustain beta cell dysfunction in diabetics can suppress expression of this transcription factor. The increased production of GLP-1 associated with frequent coffee consumption could thus be expected to counteract the adverse impact of chronic free fatty acid overexposure on beta cell function in overweight insulin resistant subjects. CGA's putative impact on glucose absorption may reflect the ability of this compound to inhibit glucose-6-phosphate translocase 1, now known to play a role in intestinal glucose transport. Delayed glucose absorption may itself protect beta cells by limiting postprandial hyperglycemia - though, owing to countervailing effects of caffeine on plasma glucose, and a paucity of relevant research studies, it is still unclear whether coffee ingestion blunts the postprandial rise in plasma glucose. More generally, diets high in "lente carbohydrate", or administration of nutraceuticals/ pharmaceuticals which stow the absorption of dietary carbohydrate, should help preserve efficient beta cell function by boosting GLP-1 production, as well as by blunting the glucotoxic impact of postprandial. hyperglycemia on beta cell function.

AB Coffee bean extract (CBE) was prepared from raw green coffee beans and contained 10.0% caffeine and 27.0% chlorogenic acid. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet containing 1% CBE for 4 weeks. Although there was no difference in food intake between rats fed the control diet without CBE and those fed the CBE-containing diet, body weight gain and white adipose tissue weight were significantly decreased in CBE-fed rats than in control rats. The CBE-fed group exerted a significant and extreme reduction in serum and liver triglyceride concentrations compared to the control group. Also, in the CBE-fed group, activities of fatty acid synthetic enzymes in the hepatic cytosol were significantly decreased, while that of fatty acid oxidative enzymes in the hepatic mitochondria was significantly, increased. Our results suggest that CBE has potent anti-obesity and hypotriglyceridemic properties, and there is a possibility that these effects are exerted at least in part by the suppression of lipogenesis and the acceleration of lipolysis.

AB OBJECTIVE - Coffee consumption is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, but the mechanism is not clearly understood. Elevated C-peptide, as a marker of insulin secretion, has been linked to insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes. In this study, we examined consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and total caffeine in relation to concentrations of plasma C-peptide.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Plasma C-peptide concentrations were measured in a cross-sectional setting among 2,112 healthy women from the Nurses' Health Study I who provided blood samples in 1989-1990. Consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and total caffeine was assessed using a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire in 1990.
   RESULTS - intakes of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and caffeine in 1990 were each inversely associated with C-peptide concentration in age-adjusted, BMI-adjusted, and multivariable-adjusted analyses. In multivariable analysis, concentrations of C-peptide were 16% less in women who drank > 4 cups/day of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee compared with nondrinkers (P < 0.005 for each). Women in the highest quintile compared with the lowest quintile of caffeine intake had 10% lower C-pepticle levels (P = 0.02). We did not find any association between tea and C-peptide. The inverse association between caffeinated coffee and C-peptide was considerably stronger in obese (27% reduction) and overweight women (20% reduction) than in normal weight women (11% reduction) (P = 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS - Our findings suggest a potential reduction of insulin secretion by coffee in women. This reduction may be related to other components in coffee rather than caffeine.

AB Context Only a few studies of coffee consumption and diabetes mellitus (DM) have been reported, even though coffee is the most consumed beverage in the world.
   Objective To determine the relationship between coffee consumption and the incidence of type 2 DM among Finnish individuals, who have the highest coffee consumption in the world.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective study from combined surveys conducted in 1982, 1987, and 1992 of 6974 Finnish men and 7655 women aged 35 to 64 years without history of stroke, coronary heart disease, or DM at baseline, with 175682 person-years of follow-up. Coffee consumption and other study parameters were determined at baseline using standardized measurements.
   Main Outcome Measures Hazard ratios (HRs) for the incidence of type 2 DM were estimated for different levels of daily coffee consumption.
   Results During a mean follow-up of 12 years, there were 381 incident cases of type 2 DM. After adjustment for confounding factors (age, study year, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, education, occupational, commuting and leisure-time physical activity, alcohol and tea consumption, and smoking), the HRs of DM associated with the amount of coffee consumed daily (0-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-9, greater than or equal to10 cups) were 1.00, 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.05), 0.39 (95% CI, 0.25-0.60), 0.39 (95% CI, 0.20-0.74), and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.06-0.69) (P for trend <.001) in women, and 1.00, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.47-1.13), 0.70 (95% CI, 0.45-1.05), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.40-1.12), and 0.45 (95% CI, 0.25-0.81) (P for trend=.12) in men, respectively. In both sexes combined, the multivariate-adjusted inverse association was significant (P for trend <.001) and persisted when stratified by younger and older than 50 years; smokers and never smokers; healthy weight, overweight, and obese participants; alcohol drinker and nondrinker; and participants drinking filtered and nonfiltered coffee.
   Conclusion Coffee drinking has a graded inverse association with the risk of type 2 DM; however, the reasons for this risk reduction associated with coffee remain unclear.

AB Context Emerging epidemiological evidence suggests that higher coffee consumption may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.
   Objective To examine the association between habitual coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes and related outcomes.
   Data Sources and Study Selection We searched MEDLINE through January 2005 and examined the reference lists of the retrieved articles. Because this review focuses on studies of habitual coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes, we excluded studies of type 1 diabetes, animal studies, and studies of short-term exposure to coffee or caffeine, leaving 15 epidemiological studies (cohort or cross-sectional).
   Data Extraction Information on study design, participant characteristics, measurement of coffee consumption and outcomes, adjustment for potential confounders, and estimates of associations was abstracted independently by 2 investigators.
   Data Synthesis We identified 9 cohort studies of coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes, including 193 473 participants and 8394 incident cases of type 2 diabetes, and calculated summary relative risks (RRs) using a random-effects model. The RR of type 2 diabetes was 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 54-0.78) for the highest (>= 6 or >= 7 cups per day) and 0.72 (95% Cl, 0.62-0.83) for the second highest (4-6 cups per day) category of coffee-consumption compared with the lowest consumption category (0 or <= 2 cups per day). These associations did not differ substantially by sex, obesity, or region (United States and Europe). In the cross-sectional studies conducted in northern Europe, southern Europe, and Japan, higher coffee consumption was consistently associated with a lower prevalence of newly detected hyperglycemia, particularly postprandial hyperglycemia.
   Conclusions This systematic review supports the hypothesis that habitual coffee consumption is associated with a substantially lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Longer-term intervention studies of coffee consumption and glucose metabolism are warranted to examine the mechanisms underlying the relationship between coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes.

AB Background: Coffee intake may be associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus because of minerals, phytochemicals, and antioxidants in coffee, but the role of caffeine is unclear. Our objective was to examine the association between total, caffeinated, and decaffeinated coffee intake, as assessed by food frequency questionnaire at baseline, and risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   Methods: This prospective analysis of the Iowa Women's Health Study (1986-1997) included 28 812 postmenopausal women free of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the general community. The main outcome measure was incident type 2 diabetes mellitus as determined by mailed questionnaire.
   Results: Coffee intake was categorized as 0, less than 1, 1 to 3, 4 to 5, and 6 or more cups per day. During 11 years of follow-up, there were 1418 incident cases of diabetes. Relative risks (RRs) were adjusted for a variety of demographic, adiposity, and lifestyle measures. Compared with women who reported 0 cups of coffee per day, women who consumed 6 or more cups per day had a 22% lower risk (RR = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.01) of diabetes (P for linear trend across categories, .06). This association appeared to be largely explained by decaffeinated coffee (RR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42-1.08; P for trend, .006) rather than regular coffee (RR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.59-1.05; P for trend, .90). Intake of magnesium and phytate did not explain these associations. Intakes of caffeine from all sources was not associated with risk of diabetes.
   Conclusion: Coffee intake, especially decaffeinated, was inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in this cohort of postmenopausal women.

AB Obesity is an important topic in the world of public health and preventive medicine. Inhibition of preadipocyte proliferation plays an important role in the mechanisms of proposed antiobesity. In this in vitro study, the inhibitory effect of phenolic acids on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was evaluated, and a relationship analysis was then conducted. The results showed that the addition of phenolic acids to the growth medium decreased the cell population growth of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The IC50 values of chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, o- coumaric acid and m-coumaric acid on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were 72.3, 43.3, 48.2, and 49.2 mu M, respectively. A relationship analysis indicated that there is a significant linear correlation between the influence of phenolic acids on cell population growth and their antioxidant activity (r=0.77, p < 0.01). The cell cycle assay indicated that the treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with chlorogenic acid, o- coumaric acid, and m-coumaric acid caused cell cycle arrest in the G(1) phase. Gallic acid did not affect the cell cycle profile; however, it increased the number of apoptotic cells (sub-G(1) phase) in a time- and dose- dependent manner. Annexin V- fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis flow cytometric assay showed that gallic acid increased the number of early apoptotic (annexin-FITC+/ PI-) and late apoptotic cells (annexin V-FITC+/ PI+) but not necrotic cells (annexin V- FITC-/PI+). The treatment of cells with gallic acid caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)). These results indicate that the inhibition of preadipocyte population growth by some phenolic acids might have further implication in in vivo antiobesity effects.

AB Background: in western populations, coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk for type 2 diabetes; however, the effect of green, black, and oolong teas is unclear.
   Objective: To examine the relationship between consumption of these beverages and risk for diabetes.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: 25 communities across Japan.
   Participants: A total of 17 413 persons (6727 men and 10 686 women; 49% of the original study population) who were 40 to 65 years of age; had no history of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at the baseline lifestyle survey; and completed the 5-year follow-up questionnaire. There was no difference in body mass index levels at baseline between respondents and non-respondents.
   Measurements: Questionnaire on consumption of coffee; black, green, and oolong teas; and physician-diagnosed diabetes. Results: During the 5-year follow-up, there were 444 self-reported new cases of diabetes in 231 men and 213 women (5-year event rates, 3.4% and 2.0%, respectively). Consumption of green tea and coffee was inversely associated with risk for diabetes after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and other risk factors. Multivariable odds ratios for diabetes among participants who frequently drank green tea and coffee ( :6 cups of green tea per day and 3 cups of coffee per day) were 0.67 (95% Cl, 0.47 to 0.94) and 0.58 (Cl, 0.37 to 0.90), respectively, compared with those who drank less than I cup per week. No association was found between consumption of black or oolong teas and the risk for diabetes. Total caffeine intake from these beverages was associated with a 33% reduced risk for diabetes. These inverse associations were more pronounced in women and in overweight men.
   Limitations: Diabetes was self-reported, no data were available on consumption of soda, and the follow-up rate was low.
   Conclusions: Consumption of green tea, coffee, and total caffeine was associated with a reduced risk for type 2 diabetes.

AB Because the potential of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) has been suggested in the management of obesity, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of yerba mate extract on weight loss, obesity-related biochemical parameters, and the regulation of adipose tissue gene expression in high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice. Thirty animals were randomly assigned to three groups. The mice were introduced to standard or high-fat diets. After 12 weeks on a high-fat diet, mice were randomly assigned according to the treatment (water or yerba mate extract 1.0 g/-kg). After treatment intervention, plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and glucose were evaluated. Adipose tissue was examined to determine the mRNA levels of several genes such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), leptin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-C motif chemokine ligand-2 (CCL2), CCL receptor-2 (CCR2), angiotensinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), adiponectin, resistin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma(2) (PPAR-gamma(2)), uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), and PPAR-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). The F4/80 levels were determined by immunoblotting. We found that obese mice treated with yerba mate exhibited marked attenuation of weight gain, adiposity, a decrease in epididymal fat-pad weight, and restoration of the serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and glucose. The gene and protein expression levels were directly regulated by the high-fat diet. After treatment with yerba mate extract, we observed a recovery of the expression levels. In conclusion, our data show that yerba mate extract has potent antiobesity activity in vivo. Additionally, we observed that the treatment had a modulatory effect on the expression of several genes related to obesity.

AB We investigated the weight loss efficacy and safety of Citrus aurantium (CA, 1,000 mg/kg diet) along with usual levels of adrenergic stimulants in foods, i.e. caffeine (100 mg/kg diet) and/or tea catechins (500 mg/kg diet), in rats for 44 or 45 days. Even in combination with caffeine and tea catechins, the suppressive effect of CA against body fat accumulation was negligible, whereas no deleterious influences concerning cardiotoxicity were observed. Thus, although the efficacy of CA for weight loss seems to be questionable, no safety problems may occur even in people who habitually consume coffee and tea. However, it is noteworthy that the intake of CA markedly elevated the urinary excretion of adrenaline, and this was not affected by intake of caffeine and/or tea catechins at the usual levels. Therefore, the safety of CA intake with high levels of caffeine and tea catechins, especially in people at risk of heart disease, remains to be elucidated further.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of weight change on the relationship between coffee and tea consumption and diabetes risk. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study, using data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow Up Study. Survival analyses were conducted using 301 selfreported cases of diabetes and eight documented diabetes deaths during an 8.4-y follow-up.
   SUBJECTS: A total of 7006 subjects aged 32-88 y with no reported history of diabetes were included in the study.
   RESULTS: For all subjects combined, increases in consumption of ground-caffeinated coffee and caffeine at baseline were followed by decreases in diabetes risk during follow-up. There were significant statistical interactions between age and consumption of caffeine (P = 0.02) and ground-caffeinated coffee (P = 0.03). Age-stratified analysis showed that the decrease in diabetes risk only applied to <= 60-y-old subjects, for whom the decrease in diabetes risk also obtained for ground-decaffeinated coffee and regular tea. The multivariate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval for a 2 cups/day increment in the intake of ground-caffeinated coffee, ground-decaffeinated coffee and regular tea was 0.86 (0.75-0.99), 0.58 (0.34-0.99) and 0.77 (0.59-1.00), respectively. The diabetes risk was negatively related to the consumption in a dose-response manner. There were strong statistical interactions between prior weight change and beverage consumption for <= 60-y-old subjects. Further analysis revealed that the decrease in diabetes risk only applied to those who had lost weight, and that there was a positive dose response relationship between diabetes risk and weight change. For example, the multivariate HR and 95% confidence interval for 40 vs 0 cups/day of ground-decaffeinated coffee was 0.17 (0.04-0.74), 0.52 (0.19-1.42), 0.77 (0.30-1.96) and 0.91 (0.39-2.14)for subgroups with weight change of <= 0, 0-10, 10-20 and > 20 lbs, respectively. There was no significant association between diabetes risk and consumption of instant-caffeinated coffee, instant-decaffeinated coffee or herbal tea. Caffeine intake appeared to explain some, but not all, of the diabetes-risk reduction and weight change.
   CONCLUSION: The negative relationship between diabetes risk and consumption of ground coffee and regular tea, observed for all NHEFS subjects, actually only applied to nonelderly adults who had previously lost weight.

AB Background/Objectives: Obesity is associated with an inflammatory state that is often characterized by elevated plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Although coffee is broadly consumed in Western societies, few studies have examined the relationship between obesity, coffee consumption and CRP levels. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between obesity, coffee consumption and variation in CRP in postmenopausal, overweight/obese women with or without hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use.
   Subjects/Methods: Cross-sectional analyses of 344 healthy sedentary, overweight/obese postmenopausal women (mean age = 57.1 +/- 6.4 years and mean body mass index (BMI) = 36.1 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2)). Plasma CRP levels were measured by a highly sensitive immunoassay that used monoclonal antibodies coated with polystyrene particles. Diet was assessed using the Food Intake and Analysis System semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire.
   Results: Plasma CRP was positively associated with BMI (P < 0.001) and negatively associated with coffee consumption (P <= 0.05). In women using HRT, plasma CRP was positively associated with BMI in women consuming less than one cup of coffee per month (r(2) = 0.15 (P < 0.001)), one cup per day (0.14 (P = 0.02)) and more than one cup per day (0.12 (P = 0.03)). In women who did not use HRT, CRP was associated with BMI only in women consuming less than one cup of coffee per day (r(2) = 0.16 (P < 0.001)) but not in women consuming one cup per day (0.06 (P = 0.10)) or more than one daily cup of coffee (0.03 (P = 0.27)).
   Conclusions: Among overweight/obese postmenopausal women, coffee consumption is negatively associated with CRP. Coffee consumption appears to attenuate the association between BMI and CRP, but only in women not using HRT.

AB Background: While high caffeine consumption has been shown to be associated with increased blood pressure in controlled experiments, the relationship between caffeine consumption and blood pressure in preadolescent (ages 6-11 years) and adolescent (ages 12-19 years) children has not been well studied. The primary objective of this study was to assess the cross-sectional relationship between caffeine intake and blood pressure in 8- to 10-year-old African American girls who eat an unrestricted diet.
   Methods: Demographic, 24-hour dietary recall, and blood pressure data collected at baseline from 303 African American girls aged 8-10 years in the Girls health Enrichment Multisite Studies (GEMS) cohort were analyzed by using linear and multiple regression models.
   Results: Dietary caffeine intake was not associated with either systolic or diastolic blood pressure (P= .33 and P = .36, respectively). However, consistent with the literature, height and body mass index were each positively and independently associated with systolic blood pressure (both P<.0001). Height and amount of sodium intake were positively associated with diastolic blood pressure (P = .01 and P = .02, respectively).
   Conclusions: Dietary caffeine intake in low amounts is not associated with elevated blood pressure in 8- to 10-year-old African American girls who eat an unrestricted diet. (Ethn Dis. 2008; 18:283-288)

AB A close relationship between coffee intake and certain metabolic disorders is known. Caffeine, one of coffee components, can increase energy expenditure (EE), but there are considerable individual differences in the caffeine effects on EE, and the causes have not been fully established in humans. The Arg allele in the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor gene (beta(3)-AR), a marker for obesity-related traits, may be a contributor to individual variations in EE. This study investigated the effect of the Arg allele of beta(3)-AR on caffeine-induced increases in EE. In 44 healthy young women (21 +/- 1 years), physical characteristics, blood pressure, biochemical profiles and dietary nutritional intake were measured. A caffeine-loading test was conducted at a dosage of 4 mg per body weight (kg). EE was measured using an indirect open-circuit calorimeter for a 10-min period before, and at 30 min and 60 min after the caffeine-loading test. The beta(3)-AR Trp64Arg polymorphism was detected with a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The frequency of the Arg allele was 24%. The distribution of the Trp/Trp, Trp/Arg, and Arg/Arg genotypes was 58%, 36%, and 6%, respectively. At the baseline, subjects with the Arg/Arg genotype had a significantly lower EE level than those with the Trp/Trp or Trp/Arg genotype. After the caffeine-loading test, there were caffeine-induced increases in EE in all genotypes, but there were no differences in the levels of increase among the genotypes. These findings suggest that the genotypes of beta(3)-AR Trp64Arg polymorphism might be not associated with caffeine-induced increases in EE levels.

AB Chlorogenic acid (5-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-CQA) is a kind of polyphenol and is richly included in green coffee beans. The inhibitory effects of 5-CQA and its components, caffeic acid (CA) and quinic acid (QA), on the two porcine pancreas (alpha-amylase (PPA) isozymes, PPA-I and PPA-II, were investigated using p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-maltoside as substrate at pH 6.9 and 30 degrees C. The inhibition potencies of the respective inhibitors against both PPA isozymes were almost the same and in the order of 5-CQA > CA >> QA. Their IC50 values were 0.07-0.08 mM, 0.37-0.40 mM, and 25.3-26.5 mM, respectively. The inhibition mechanisms of 5-CQA and CA were investigated by kinetic analyses, and the inhibitor constants K-i and K-i' (for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex, respectively) were determined. It was indicated that 5-CQA and CA showed mixed-type inhibition with Ki > Ki' against both PPA-I and PPA-II. The binding of PPA-I or PPA-II with 5-CQA or CA was all exothermic and enthalpy-driven. CIA is a poor inhibitor, and its inhibitory mode was unique and hardly analyzed by a simple Michaelis-Menten-type interaction between the enzyme and inhibitor. However, it was shown that the inhibitory activity of CA was enhanced 5 times by ester-bond formation with QA in the form of 5-CQA. These results provide us with significant hints for the development of alpha-amylase inhibitors useful for the prevention of diabetes and obesity.

AB Objective: Investigation of the effect of a green tea-caffeine mixture on weight maintenance after body weight loss in moderately obese subjects in relation to habitual caffeine intake.
   Research Methods and Procedures: A randomized placebo-controlled double blind parallel trial in 76 overweight and moderately obese subjects, (BMI, 27.5 +/- 2.7 kg/m(2)) matched for sex, age, BMI, height, body mass, and habitual caffeine intake was conducted. A very low energy diet intervention during 4 weeks was followed by 3 months of weight maintenance (WM); during the WM period, the subjects received a green tea-caffeine mixture (270 mg epigallocatechin gallate + 150 mg caffeine per day) or placebo.
   Results: Subjects lost 5.9 +/- 1.8 (SD) kg (7.0 +/- 2.1%) of body weight (p < 0.001). At baseline, satiety was positively, and in women, leptin was inversely, related to subjects' habitual caffeine consumption (p < 0.01). High caffeine consumers reduced weight, fat mass, and waist circumference more than low caffeine consumers; resting energy expenditure was reduced less and respiratory quotient was reduced more during weight loss (p < 0.01). In the low caffeine consumers, during WM, green tea still reduced body weight, waist, respiratory quotient and body fat, whereas resting energy expenditure was increased compared with a restoration of these variables with placebo (p < 0.01). In the high caffeine consumers, no effects of the green tea-caffeine mixture were observed during WM.
   Discussion: High caffeine intake was associated with weight loss through thermogenesis and fat oxidation and with suppressed leptin in women. In habitual low caffeine consumers, the green tea-caffeine mixture improved WM, partly through thermogenesis and fat oxidation.

AB The intake of caffeine (CF) at 0.025, 0.05 or 0.1 % for 21 days progressively reduced the body fat mass and body fat percentage in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats fed on a high-fat diet with increasing administration level. Moreover, CF increased the serum concentrations of catecholamines and free fatty acids in SD rats orally administered with CF (5 mg/kg). These results suggest that the intake of CF reduced body fat by lipolysis via catecholamines. CF has potential as a functional food ingredient with an anti-obesity action.

AB OBJECTIVE - We investigated the effect of caffeine ingestion oil insulin sensitivity in sedentary lean men (n = 8) and obese men with (n = 7) and without (11 = 8) type 2 diabetes. We also examined whether chronic exercise influences the relationship between caffeine and insulin sensitivity in these individuals.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Subjects underwent two hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedures, caffeine (5 mg/kg body wt) and placebo, in a double-blind, randomized manner before and after a 3-month aerobic exercise program. Body composition was measured by magnetic resonance imaging.
   RESULTS - At baseline, caffeine ingestion was associated with a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in insulin sensitivity by a similar magnitude in the lean (33%), obese (33%), and type 2 diabetic (37%) groups in comparison with placebo. After exercise training, caffeine ingestion was Still associated with a reduction (P < 0.05) in insulin sensitivity by a similar magnitude in the lean (23%), obese (26%), and type 2 diabetic (36%) groups in comparison with placebo, Exercise was not associated with a significant increase in insulin sensitivity in either the caffeine or placebo trials, independent of group (P > 0.10).
   CONCLUSIONS - Caffeine consumption is associated with a substantial reduction in insulin-mediated glucose uptake independent of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and chronic exercise.

AB The present study was conducted to investigate whether green tea may improve weight maintenance by preventing or limiting weight regain after weight loss of 5 to 10 % in overweight and moderately obese subjects. The study had a randomised, parallel, placebo-controlled design. A total of 104 overweight and moderately obese male and female subjects (age 18-60 years; BMI 25-35 kg/m(2)) participated. The study consisted of a very-low-energy diet intervention (VLED; 2.1 MJ/d) of 4 weeks followed by a weight-maintenance period of 13 weeks in which the subjects received green tea or placebo. The green tea contained caffeine (104 mg/d) and catechins (573 mg/d, of which 323 mg was epigallocatechin gallate). Subjects lost 6.4 (SD 1.9) kg or 7.5 (SD 2.2) % of their original body weight during the VLED (P<0.001). Body-weight regain was not significantly different between the green tea and the placebo group (30.5 (SD 61.8) % and 19.7 (SD 56.9) %, respectively). In the green tea treatment, habitual high caffeine consumption was associated with a higher weight regain compared with habitual low caffeine consumption (39 (SD 17) and 16 (SD 11) %, respectively; P<0.05). We conclude that weight maintenance after 7.5 % body-weight loss was not affected by green tea treatment and that habitual caffeine consumption affected weight maintenance in the green tea treatment.

AB Caffeine ingestion negatively affects insulin sensitivity during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in lean and obese men, but this has not been studied in individuals with type 2 diabetes. We examined the effects of caffeine ingestion on insulin and glucose homeostasis in obese men with type 2 diabetes. Men (n = 12) with type 2 diabetes (age = 49 +/- 2 y, BMI = 32 +/- 1 kg/m(2)) underwent 2 trials, 1 wk apart, in a randomized, double-blind design. Each trial was conducted after withdrawal from caffeine, alcohol, exercise, and oral hypoglycemic agents for 48 h and an overnight fast. Subjects randomly ingested caffeine (5 mg/kg body weight) or placebo capsules and 1 h later began a 3 h 75 g OGTT. Caffeine increased (P < 0.05) serum insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide concentrations during the OGTT relative to placebo. Insulin area under the curve was 25% greater (P < 0.05) after caffeine than after placebo ingestion. Despite this, blood glucose concentration was also increased (P < 0.01) in the caffeine trial. After caffeine ingestion, blood glucose remained elevated (P < 0.01) at 3 h postglucose load (8.9 +/- 0.7 mmol/L) compared with baseline (6.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/L). The insulin sensitivity index was lower (14%, P = 0.02) after caffeine than after placebo ingestion. Overall, despite elevated and prolonged proinsulin, C-peptide, and insulin responses after caffeine ingestion, blood glucose was also increased, suggesting an acute caffeine-induced impairment in blood glucose management in men with type 2 diabetes.

AB Background: The effect of coffee consumption on the cardiovascular system is conflicting. Inflammation is important to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and several dietary factors are thought to exert significant effects on inflammation and thus on the risk of CVD.
   Objective: We aimed to investigate the associations between coffee consumption and inflammatory markers.
   Design: The cross-sectional survey enrolled 1514 men ((x) over bar +/- SD age: 46 +/- 13 y; range: 18-87 y) and 1528 women (aged 45 +/- 13 y; range: 18-89 y). Five percent of men and 3% of women were excluded for history of CVD. Fasting blood samples were collected. Dietary habits (including consumption of various types of coffee) were evaluated by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire.
   Results: Compared with coffee nondrinkers, men who consumed >200 mL coffee/d had 50% higher interleukin 6 (IL-6), 30% higher C-reactive protein (CRP), 12% higher serum amyloid-A (SAA), and 28% higher tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations and 3% higher white blood cell (WBC) counts (all: P < 0.05). Women who consumed >200 mL coffee/d had 54% higher IL-6, 38% higher CRP, 28% higher SAA, and 28% higher TNF-alpha concentrations and 4% higher WBC counts (all: P < 0.05) than did coffee nondrinkers. The findings were significant even after control for the interactions between coffee consumption and age, sex, smoking, body mass index, physical activity status, and other covariates.
   Conclusions: A relation exists between moderate-to-high coffee consumption and increased inflammation process. This relation could explain, in part, the effect of increased coffee intake on the cardiovascular system.

   VOLUNTEERS; INGESTION
AB Background: Caffeine ingestion stimulates both lipolysis and energy expenditure.
   Objectives: Our objectives were to determine whether the lipolytic effect of caffeine is associated with increased lipid oxidation or futile cycling between triacylglycerol and free fatty acids (FFAs) and whether the effects of caffeine are mediated via the sympathetic nervous system.
   Design: Respiratory exchange and [1-C-13] palmitate were used to trace lipid oxidation and FFA turnover in 8 healthy, young men for 90 min before and 240 min after ingestion of placebo, caffeine (10 mg/kg), or caffeine during beta-adrenoceptor blockade.
   Results: During fasting conditions, there were few differences in measured variables between the 3 tests. During steady state conditions (last hour of the test) after ingestion of caffeine, lipid turnover increased 2-fold (P < 0.005), and the mean (+/-SEM) thermic effect was 13.3 +/- 2.2% (P < 0.001), both of which were greater than after ingestion of placebo or caffeine during beta-adrenoceptor blockade. After ingestion of caffeine, oxidative FFA disposal increased 44% (236 +/- 21 to 340 +/- 16 mumol/min), whereas nonoxidative FFA disposal increased 2.3-fold (455 +/- 66 to 1054 +/- 242 mumol/min; P < 0.01). In postabsorptive conditions, 34% of lipids were oxidized and 66% were recycled. Caffeine ingestion increased energy expenditure 13% and doubled the turnover of lipids, of which 24% were oxidized and 76% were recycled. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade decreased, but did not inhibit, these variables.
   Conclusions: Many, but not all, of the effects of caffeine are mediated via the sympathetic nervous system. The effect of caffeine on lipid mobilization in resting conditions can be interpreted in 2 ways: lipid mobilization alone is insufficient to drive lipid oxidation, or large increments in lipid turnover result in small increments in lipid oxidation.

AB Background: Green tea (epigallocatechin gallate + caffeine) and protein each were shown to improve body weight maintenance after weight loss.
   Objective: We investigated the effect of a green tea - caffeine mixture added to a high-protein (HP) diet on weight maintenance (WM) after body weight loss in moderately obese subjects.
   Design: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial was conducted in 80 overweight and moderately obese subjects [age (mean +/- SD): 44 +/- 2 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)): 29.6 +/- 2.0] matched for sex, age, BMI, height, body mass, and with a habitually low caffeine intake. A very-low-energy diet intervention during 4 wk was followed by 3 mo of WM; during the WM period, the subjects received a green tea - caffeine mixture (270 mg epigallocatechin gallate + 150 mg caffeine/d) or placebo, both in addition to an adequate protein (AP) diet (50 - 60 g protein/d) or an HP diet (100 - 120 g protein/d).
   Results: Subjects lost 7.0 +/- 1.6 kg, or 8.2 +/- 2.0%, body weight (P < 0.001). During the WM phase, WM, resting energy expenditure, and fat-free mass (FFM) increased relatively in both the HP groups and in the AP + green tea - caffeine mixture group (P < 0.05), whereas respiratory quotient and body fat mass decreased, all compared with the AP + placebo group. Satiety increased only in both HP groups (P < 0.05). The green tea - caffeine mixture was only effective with the AP diet.
   Conclusion: The green tea - caffeine mixture, as well as the HP diet, improved WM independently through thermogenesis, fat oxidation, sparing FFM, and, for the HP diet, satiety; a possible synergistic effect failed to appear. Am J Clin Nutr 2009; 89: 822-30.

SO PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE

AB Introduction
   Calorie intake from beverages has increased in the past decades, which most likely contributes to higher obesity rates. Although coffee chains have grown in popularity in recent years, few data examine the calorie contribution of these drinks. We examined afternoon beverage purchases in New York City at 2 major coffee chains and estimated the mean calorie content of these beverages.
   Methods
   We collected purchase receipts and brief surveys from adult customers at 42 Starbucks and 73 Dunkin' Donuts stores during the spring of 2007. For each purchase, we obtained the calorie content from the company's Web site; these values were adjusted to account for self-reported customization of the drink.
   Results
   We included 1,127 beverage purchases at Starbucks and 1,830 at Dunkin' Donuts in our analyses. Brewed coffee or tea averaged 63 kcal, and blended coffee beverages averaged 239 kcal. Approximately two-thirds of purchases at Starbucks and one-fourth of purchases at Dunkin' Donuts were blended coffee beverages.
   Conclusion
   Calories in blended coffee beverages are high; on average, customers bought 12% of a 2,000-kcal diet. Policy changes to provide for calorie posting at the point of purchase could increase customer awareness of the calories in these beverages; modifying standard formulations of blended coffee beverages, such as using low-fat milk or smaller serving sizes, would also reduce calorie content.

AB Systemic caffeine clearance is considered the gold standard for phenotyping cytochrome P450 1A2 in epidemiological studies, and has been recommended for the non-invasive assessment of liver function in chronic liver disease. Our aim was to find a valid, simple and reliable alternative to this method, and therefore focused our attention on the measurement of an unique salivary caffeine concentration, without drug exposure.
   Our evaluation included 36 healthy controls, 47 patients with compensated liver cirrhosis of viral origin, and 48 obese and diabetic patients with cryptogenetic (likely metabolic) cirrhosis. All shared the same caffeine consumption habits (regular daily use of caffeinated beverages, mainly coffee). The total overnight salivary caffeine assessment (TOSCA) was determined by using a single-point concentration of salivary caffeine, after an overnight period of abstinence.
   Daily routine caffeine intake of our population was adequate for studying the TOSCA. This single-point concentration correlated well with caffeine clearance, measured by salivary concentrations of caffeine. Mean TOSCA in cirrhotic patients was significantly higher than in controls (p < 0.001; sensitivity (%) 84.2 and specificity (%) 97.2; negative likelihood ratio=0.16 and positive likelihood ratio=30.32). A cut-off set at 4.2 mu g/ml (sensitivity (%) 95.8 and specificity (%) 68.1; negative likelihood ratio=0.06 and positive likelihood ratio=3.0) successfully differentiated the type of cirrhosis. Rapid (with higher metabolism of caffeine) metabolizers were more frequent in the group of patients with cirrhosis of metabolic origin (70.8%; p < 0.0001), and the opposite was true for the group of patients with cirrhosis of viral origin, which comprised many poor metabolizers (85.1%; p < 0.001). Serum transforming growth factor-beta 1 concentration, mirroring ongoing fibrosis, ranked high in poor metabolizers. The association between overnight assessment and homeostasis model assessment in rapid metabolizers could result from similar roles for cytochrome P450 1A2 and insulin resistance in determining metabolic liver cirrhosis.
   The TOSCA, although differential between the viral and metabolic etiologies, could be considered a good diagnostic use to verify the presence and eventually the type of compensated liver cirrhosis

AB In vivo studies confirmed that chlorogenic acid (CGA) improved glucose tolerance and mineral pool distribution in obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats. We found a significant decrease (P < .05) in postprandial blood glucose concentrations, which may have been due to an improved sensitivity to insulin. Impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance have been associated with differences in the hepatic mRNA expression of the spliced variants of the insulin receptor at exon 11. Spliced variants of the insulin receptor have not been studied in obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats, and no information exists about the effects of CGA in vivo as a possible insulin sensitizer. Thus, we studied the in vivo effect of CGA on plasma insulin concentrations during a glucose tolerance test, liver protein and DNA concentrations, the hepatic activity of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-PASE) and the mRNA expression of the two variants of the insulin receptor at exon 11. Zucker (fa/fa) rats were implanted with jugular vein catheters. Chlorogenic acid was administered (5 mg/kg body weight per day) for 3 weeks via intravenous infusion.
   In the CGA-treated group, areas under the curve (AUC) for blood glucose and plasma insulin improved (P < .005), and the protein and DNA concentrations in the liver increased (P < .05). No significant differences (P > .05) were found between groups for the hepatic G-6-PASE activity. The insulin receptor exon 11(+) and the exon 11(-) variants were expressed in the liver of Zucker (fa/fa) rats without significant changes (P > .05). Chlorogenic acid improved some cellular mechanisms that are stimulated by insulin. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of a dietary supplement with a low dose of ephedra and caffeine in overweight/obese premenopausal female subjects.
   Design: A 9-month, double-blind, randomized control study compared the efficacy and safety of a dietary supplement with ephedra and caffeine to a control supplement.
   Subjects: Sixty-one healthy, premenopausal women with body mass index (BMI) from 27 to 39 kg/m(2) were randomly assigned and received a dietary supplement (40 mg/day ephedra alkaloids, 100 mg/day caffeine, high potency mixture of vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids) or a control supplement for 9 months.
   Measurements: Efficacy: changes in body weight, body composition, lipids, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, and self-reports of physical activity, diet and quality of life indices. Safety: blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiograms, urinalysis, blood histology, serum chemistry measures and self-reported symptoms.
   Results: Forty-one women completed the study. The treatment group lost significantly more body weight (-7.18 kg) and body fat (-5.33 kg) than the control group (-2.25 and -0.99 kg, respectively), and showed significant declines in heart rate, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein ratio, glucose, fasting insulin, and leptin. Blood pressure, electrocardiograms, other clinical chemistry measures, blood histology, urinalysis, and self- reported physical activity were similar in the groups. Minor symptoms included dry mouth, insomnia, nervousness and palpitations. The treatment group reported more energy and decreased appetite compared to controls and scored higher on a quality of life domain assessing vitality.
   Conclusion: A dietary supplement containing a low potency ephedra/caffeine mixture appeared safe and effective in causing loss of weight and body fat, and improving several metabolic parameters, including insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles when tested under physician supervision. Such supplements could be a useful tool to assist with weight loss.

AB Introduction: There is growing interest in how the physical environment influences obesity. Few studies have considered how the food retail environment surrounding schools influences overweight in students.
   Objective: To determine whether there is a relationship between food retailers surrounding schools and overweight among Canadian Youth.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting/methods/subjects: The number of food retailers was obtained within a 1 kin and 5 kin radius around 178 schools in Canada. Retailers included full-service restaurants, fast-food restaurants, sub/sandwich retailers, doughnut/coffee shops, convenience stores and grocery stores. An index of total food retailer exposure was also created. Multilevel analyses were used to control for individual-and area-level covariates.
   Results: None of the individual food retailers was associated with an increased likelihood of overweight. The total food retailer index was most strongly related to overweight, but in the opposite direction to that hypothesized. At 1 kin, students attending schools with at least one food retailer had a lower relative odds of overweight (OR = 0.70, 95 % CI 0.61: 0.81). At 5 km, Students attending schools with the highest exposure to the total food retailer index had a lower relative odds of overweight (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.47, 0.68) compared With Students attending schools with no exposure.
   Conclusions: Exposure to various types of food retailers in school neighbourhoods was not associated with an increased likelihood of overweight in Canadian school-aged Youth. The opportunity to make healthy choices from a variety of options and the unique Canadian context may explain the findings.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and side effects of an herbal formulation to promote weight loss, as compared to placebo.
   DESIGN: 12-week multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel groups design. Study conducted at three clinical sites in New York State. Subjects were randomized to receive either the 'active' product or a 'placebo' supplement for 12 weeks. Minimal steps were taken to influence lifestyle changes with regard to diet or exercise.
   SUBJECTS: 102 overweight/obese (30<BMI <= 39.9 kg/m(2)) volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65 y.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight, percent body fat, fat mass, waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, and pulse measured at 2 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks postrandomization.
   RESULTS: Subjects receiving the 'active' treatment experienced, on average, an additional 1.5 kg of weight loss compared with subjects receiving the placebo. In addition, subjects receiving the 'active' treatment experienced greater reductions in BMI and waist circumference over the 12-week period. No differences were observed with respect to percent body fat, fat mass, diastolic or systolic blood pressure, pulse, the occurrence of any adverse event, or the occurrence of any presumed treatment-related adverse event. Testing of the study product by two independent laboratories indicated that it had only approximately half of the intended amount of ephedrine alkaloids and caffeine.
   CONCLUSIONS: Over the 12-week trial, subjects on the active treatment experienced significantly greater weight loss than subjects on placebo, without an increase in blood pressure, pulse, or the rate of adverse events. These benefits were achieved in the absence of any lifestyle treatment to change dietary or exercise behavior and with lower doses of ephedrine alkaloids and caffeine than those commonly utilized.

AB The viewpoint presented in this article is that soft drink consumption is a contributing factor in the rising incidence of overweight among school-aged children. Misinformation must be dispelled so that resources can be directed to real, evidence-based concerns. Child nutrition advocates have called for reducing access to soft drinks in schools as an important step in optimizing healthful environments for children. School nutrition policies are being revised at national, state, and local levels. Along with other stakeholders, soft drink manufacturers must acknowledge the problem of rising rates of overweight in children and work within their spheres of influence to limit access to soft drinks in schools.

DT Article
ID TYPE-2 DIABETES-MELLITUS; TOLERANCE TEST; INSULIN SENSITIVITY; RISK;
   INGESTION; HUMANS; WOMEN; MANAGEMENT; INCREASES; SECRETION
AB Background: The ingestion of caffeine (5 mg/kg body weight) and a 75-g oral glucose load has been shown to elicit an acute insulin-insensitive environment in healthy and obese individuals and in those with type 2 diabetes.
   Objective: In this study we investigated whether a similar impairment in blood glucose management exists when coffee and foods typical of a Western diet were used in a similar protocol.
   Design: Ten healthy men underwent 4 trials in a randomized order. They ingested caffeinated (5 mg/kg) coffee (CC) or the same volume of decaffeinated coffee (DC) followed 1 h later by either a high or low glycemic index (GI) cereal (providing 75 g of carbohydrate) mixed meal tolerance test.
   Results: CC with the high GI meal resulted in 147%, 29%, and 40% greater areas under the curve for glucose (P < 0.001), insulin (NS), and C-peptide (P < 0.001), respectively, compared with the values for DC. Similarly, with the low GI treatment, CC elicited 216%, 44%, and 36% greater areas under the curve for glucose (P < 0.001), insulin (P < 0.01), and C-peptide (P < 0.01), respectively. Insulin sensitivity was significantly reduced (40%) with the high GI treatment after CC was ingested compared with DC; with the low GI treatment, CC ingestion resulted in a 29% decrease in insulin sensitivity, although this difference was not significant.
   Conclusion: The ingestion of CC with either a high or low GI meal significantly impairs acute blood glucose management and insulin sensitivity compared with ingestion of DC. Future investigations are warranted to determine whether CC is a risk factor for insulin resistance.

AB This study evaluated the influence of a green tea catechin beverage on body composition and fat distribution in overweight and obese adults during exercise-induced weight loss. Participants (n = 132 with 107 completers) were randomly assigned to receive a beverage containing similar to 625 mg of catechins with 39 mg caffeine or a control beverage (39 mg caffeine, nocatechins) for 12 wk. Participants were asked to maintain constant energy intake and engage in >= 180 min/wk moderate intensity exercise, including >= 3 supervised sessions per week. Body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry), abdominal fat areas (computed tomography), and clinical laboratory tests were measured at baseline and wk 12. There was a trend (P = 0.079) toward greater loss of body weight in the catechin group compared with the control group; least squares mean (95% Cl) changes, adjusted for baseline value, age, and sex, were -2.2 (-3.1, -1.3) and -1.0 (-1.9, -0.1) kg, respectively. Percentage changes in fat mass did not differ between the catechin [5.2 (-7.0, -3.4)] and control groups 1-3.5 (-5.4, 1.6)] (P = 0.208). However, percentage changes in total abdominal fat area [-7.7 (-11.7, -3.8) vs. -0.3 (-4.4, 3.9); P = 0.013], subcutaneous abdominal fat area [-6.2 (-10.2, -2.2) vs. 0.8 (-3.3, 4.9); P = 0.0191, and fasting serum triglycerides (TG) [-11.2 (-18.8, -3.6) vs. 1.9 (-5.9, 9.7); P = 0.023] were greater in the catechin group. These findings suggest that green tea catechin consumption enhances exercise-induced changes in abdominal fat and serum TG. J. Nutr. 139: 264-270, 2009.

   SYNTHESIS; BODY-WEIGHT; DE-NOVO
AB Background: Dairy calcium supplementation has been proposed to increase fat oxidation and to inhibit lipogenesis.
   Objective: We aimed to investigate the effects of calcium supplementation on markers of fat metabolism.
   Design: In a placebo-controlled, crossover experiment, 10 overweight or obese subjects who were low calcium consumers received 800 mg dairy Ca/d for 5 wk. After 4 wk, adipose tissue was taken for biopsy for analysis of gene expression. Respiratory exchange, glycerol turnover, and subcutaneous adipose tissue microdialysis were performed for 7 h after consumption of 400 mg Ca or placebo, and the ingestion of either randomized slow-release caffeine (SRC; 300 mg) or lactose (500 mg). One week later, the test was repeated with the SRC or lactose crossover.
   Results: Calcium supplementation increased urinary calcium excretion by 16% (P = 0.017) but did not alter plasma parathyroid hormone or osteocalcin concentrations. Resting energy expenditure (59.9 +/- 3.0 or 59.6 +/- 3.3 kcal/ h), fat oxidation (58.4 +/- 2.5 or 53.8 +/- 2.2 mg/ min), plasma free fatty acid concentrations (0.63 +/- 0.02 or 0.62 +/- 0.03 mmol/ L), and glycerol turnover (3.63 +/- 0.41 or 3.70 +/- 0.38 mu mol . kg(-1) . min(-1)) were similar with or without calcium, respectively. SRC significantly increased free fatty acid concentrations, resting fat oxidation, and resting energy expenditure. During microdialysis, epinephrine increased dialysate glycerol concentrations by 250% without and 254% with calcium. Expression of 7 key metabolic genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue was not affected by calcium supplementation.
   Conclusion: Dairy calcium supplementation in overweight subjects with habitually low calcium intakes failed to alter fat metabolism and energy expenditure under resting conditions and during acute stimulation by caffeine or epinephrine.

AB Among the health-promoting effects of tea and tea polyphenols, the cancer-chemopreventive effects in various animal model systems have been intensively investigated; meanwhile, the hypolipidemic and antiobesity effects in animals and humans have also become a hot issue for molecular nutrition and food research. It has been demonstrated that the body weights of rats and their plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol have been significantly reduced by feedings of oolong, black, pu-erh, and green tea leaves to the animals. It has been suggested that the inhibition of growth and suppression of lipogenesis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells may be through down-regulation of fatty acid synthase gene expression in the nucleus and stimulation of cell energy expenditure in the mitochondria. The experimental data indicated that the molecular mechanisms of fatty acid synthase gene suppression by tea polyphenols (EGCG, theaflavins) may invite down-regulation of EGFR/PI3K/Akt/Sp1 signal transduction pathways.

AB The present study investigated the lipolytic (break of fat stored) effect of a citrus-based polyphenolic dietary supplement (SINETROL) at human adipocytes (ex vivo), body fat (clinical) and biochemical levels (inhibition of phosphodiesterase). Free fatty acids (FFA) release was used as indicator of human adipocyte lipolysis and SINETROL activity has been compared with known lipolytic products (isoproterenol, theopylline and caffeine). SINETROL stimulated significantly the lipolytic activity in a range of 6 fold greater than the control. Moreover, SINETROL has 2.1 greater activity than guarana 12% caffeine while its content in caffeine is 3 times lower. Clinically, two groups of 10 volunteers with BMI relevant of overweight were compared during 4 and 12 weeks with 1.4 g/day SINETROL and placebo supplementation. In the SINETROL Group the body fat (%) decreased with a significant difference of 5.53% and 15.6% after 4 and 12 weeks, respectively, while the body weight (kg) decreased with a significant difference of 2.2 and 5.2 kg after 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. These observed effects are linked to SINETROL polyphenolic composition and its resulting synergistic activity. SINETROL is a potent inhibitor of cAMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) (97%) compared to other purified compounds (cyanidin-3 glycoside, narangin, caffeine). These results suggest that SINETROL has a strong lipolytic effect mediated by cAMP-PDE inhibition. SINETROL may serve to prevent obesity by decreasing BMI. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

AB The global prevalence of obesity has increased considerably in the last decade. Tools for obesity management, including caffeine, ephedrine, capsaicin, and green tea have been proposed as strategies for weight loss and weight maintenance, since they may increase energy expenditure and have been proposed to counteract the decrease in metabolic rate that is present during weight loss. A combination of caffeine and ephedrine has shown to be effective in long-term weight management, likely due to different mechanisms that may operate synergistically, e.g., respectively inhibiting the phosphodiesterase-induced degradation of cAMP and enhancing the sympathetic release of catecholamines. However, adverse effects of ephedrine prevent the feasibility of this approach. Capsaicin has been shown to be effective, yet when it is used clinically it requires a strong compliance to a certain dosage, that has not been shown to be feasible yet. Also positive effects on body-weight management have been shown using green tea mixtures. Green tea, by containing both tea catechins and caffeine, may act through inhibition of catechol O-methyl-transferase, and inhibition of phosphodiesterase. Here, the mechanisms may also operate synergistically. In addition, tea catechins have antiangiogenic properties that may prevent development of overweight and obesity. Furthermore, the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the regulation of lipolysis, and the sympathetic innervation of white adipose tissue may play an important role in the regulation of total body fat in general.

AB Obesity and the related disorders, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia have reached epidemic proportions world-wide. The influence of 70 plants, herbs and spices on peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma activation or antagonism, a drug target for metabolic syndrome, was investigated. Approximately 50 different plant extracts bound PPAR gamma in competitive ligand binding assay, including pomegranate, apple, clove, cinnamon, thyme, green coffee, bilberry and bay leaves. Five plant extracts transactivated PPAR gamma in chimeric GAL4-PPAR gamma-LBD system: nutmeg, licorice, black pepper, holy basil and sage. Interestingly, nearly all plant extracts antagonized rosiglitazone-mediated coactivator recruitment in time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer coactivator assay. The five transactivating extracts may function as selective PPAR gamma modulators (SPPAR gamma Ms), and the other extracts seem to be moderate antagonists or undetectable/weak SPPAR gamma Ms. As SPPAR gamma Ms improve insulin resistance without weight gain and PPAR gamma antagonists exert antiobesity action, a combination of these plants in diet could reduce obesity and the incidence of metabolic syndrome.

AB To elucidate the anti-obesity effects of three major components of green tea, catechins, caffeine and theanine, female ICR mice were fed on diets containing 2% green tea powder and diets containing 0.3% catechins, 0.05% caffeine and 0.03% theanine, which correspond, respectively, to their concentrations in a 2% green tea powder diet, singly and in combination for 16 weeks. Body weight and food intake were determined monthly during this period, kidneys, adrenals, liver, spleen, brain, pituitary and intraperitoneal adipose tissues (IPAT) were weighed and lipid levels in the serum and liver were measured at the end of this period. The body weight increase and weight of IPA T were significantly reduced by the diets containing green tea, caffeine, theanine, caffeine + catechins, caffeine + theanine and caffeine + catechins + theanine. Noticeably, the IPA T weight decreased by 76.8% in the caffeine + catechins compared to the control group. Serum concentrations of triglycerides (TG) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were decreased by green tea, catechins and theanine. Moreover, caffeine + catechins, caffeine + theanine and caffeine + catechins + theanine also decreased NEFA in the serum. The TG level in the liver was significantly reduced by catechins and catechins + theanine in comparison with the control. These results indicated that at least caffeine and theanine were responsible for the suppressive effect of green tea powder (GTP) on body weight increase and fat accumulation. Moreover, it was shown that catechins and caffeine were synergistic in anti-obesity activities.

AB To understand the mechanisms of the anti-obesity effects of dietary caffeine, the effects of caffeine and its metabolites on adipocyte differentiation and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes were investigated. Caffeine did not inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes to mature adipocytes, but it did suppress the intracellular lipid accumulation after complete differentiation in a dose-dependent manner (0.125-1.0 mM). This effect was also observed in 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid-3,7-dimethyluric acid-and 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil-treated cells. Caffeine also inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with theophylline, paraxanthine, 1-methylxanthine (MX), 3-MX, or 7-MX also inhibited glucose uptake in differentiated adipocytes. These results suggest that the anti-obesity activity of dietary caffeine is due to the additive and/or synergistic inhibitory effects of caffeine and its metabolites on intracellular lipid accumulation and that caffeine does not affect adipocyte differentiation.

AB 1. In the present study, we conducted the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of bofu-tsusho-san (BF), an oriental herbal medicine (24 mg/day ephedrine in Ephedrae Herba and an efficacy equivalent of 280 mg caffeine, judging from the phosphodiesterase-inhibitory effect of Glycyrrhizae Radix, Forsythiae Fructus and Schizonepetae Spica and another 14 crude drugs) in obese women with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).
   2. The aim of the present study was to determine whether BF was effective in decreasing visceral adiposity and insulin resistance. Eighty-one Japanese women (body mass index (BMI) 36.5 +/- 4.8 kg/m(2)) with IGT and insulin resistance (IR), who had been treated with a low-calorie diet (5016 kj/day: 1200 kcal) and an exercise regimen (1254 kj/day: 300 kcal), were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 40) or BIT treatment (n = 41) three times a day.
   3. After 24 weeks treatment, the BF group lost significantly (P < 0.01) more bodyweight and abdominal visceral fat without a decrease in the adjusted resting metabolic rate (RMR), whereas the placebo group lost bodyweight (P < 0.05) and had no significant change in abdominal visceral fat. The BF group had a lower fasting serum insulin level (P < 0.05), a lower insulin area under the curve (P < 0.05) and a lower level of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (P < 0.01) compared with values before treatment.
   4. We conclude that BF could be a useful herbal medicine in treating obesity with IGT.

AB We assessed the effect of ingestion of green tea (GT) extract along with a low-energy diet (LED) on resting energy expenditure (REE), substrate oxidation and body weight as GT has been shown to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation in the short term in both animals and people. Forty-six overweight women (BMI 27 center dot 6 (sd 1 center dot 8) kg/m(2)) were fed in energy balance from day 1 to day 3, followed by a LED with GT (1125 mg tea catechins +225 mg caffeine/d) or placebo (PLAC) from day 4 to day 87. Caffeine intake was standardised to 300 mg/d. Energy expenditure was measured on days 4 and 32. Reductions in weight (4 center dot 19 (sd 2 center dot 0) kg PLAC, 4 center dot 21 (sd 2 center dot 7) kg GT), BMI, waist:hip ratio, fat mass and fat-free mass were not statistically different between treatments. REE as a function of fat-free mass and fat mass was significantly reduced over 32 d in the PLAC group (P < 0 center dot 05) but not in the GT group. Dietary restraint increased over time (P < 0 center dot 001) in both groups, whereas disinhibition and general hunger decreased (P < 0 center dot 05). The GT group became more hungry over time and less thirsty, and showed increased prospective food consumption compared with PLAC (P < 0 center dot 05). Taken together, the ingestion of GT along with a LED had no additional benefit for any measures of body weight or body composition. Although the decrease in REE as a function of fat-free mass and fat mass was not significant with GT treatment, whereas it was with PLAC treatment, no significant effect of treatment over time was seen, suggesting that a robust limitation of REE reduction during a LED was not achieved by GT.

AB Over 60% of soft-drinks sold in the United States contain caffeine, a mildly addictive psycho-active chemical, as a flavor additive. Using sweeteners as controls, we assessed whether caffeine has flavor activity in a cola soft-drink. A forced-choice triangle discrimination methodology was used to determine detection thresholds of caffeine in sweeteners and a cola beverage. The subjects (n = 30, 28 female, 23 +/- 4 years old) were trained tasters and completed over 1600 discrimination tests during the study. The mean detection thresholds for caffeine in the sweet solutions were: 0.333 +/- 0.1 mM sucrose; 0.467 +/- 0.29mM aspartame; 0.462 +/- 0.3mM sucralose, well below the concentration in common cola beverages (0.55-0.67 mM). A fixed concentration of caffeine, corresponding to the concentration of caffeine in a common cola beverage (0.67 mM) was added to the sweeteners and a non-caffeinated cola beverage. Subjects could distinguish between caffeinated and non-caffeinated sweeteners (p < 0.001), but all subjects failed to distinguish between caffeinated and non-caffeinated cola beverage (p = 1.0). Caffeine has no flavor activity in soft-drinks yet will induce a physiologic and psychologic desire to consume the drink. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent epidemiological studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of coffee consumption for the prevention of type 2 diabetes, however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. We demonstrate that coffee extract, corresponding to an Italian Espresso, inhibits recombinant and endogenous 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 beta-HSD1) activity. The inhibitory component is heat-stable with considerable polarity. Coffee extract blocked 11 beta-HSD1-dependent cortisol formation, prevented the subsequent nuclear translocation of the glueocorticoid receptor and abolished glucocorticoid-induced expression of the key gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. We suggest that at least part of the anti-diabetic effects of coffee consumption is due to inhibition of 11 beta-HSD1-dependent glucocorticoid reactivation.

AB Adipose tissue secretions play an important role in the development of obesity-related pathologies such as diabetes. Through inflammatory cytokines production, adipose tissue stromavascular fraction cells (SVF), and essentially macrophages, promote adipocyte insulin resistance by a paracrine way. Since xanthine family compounds such as caffeine were shown to decrease inflammatory production by human blood cells, we investigated the possible effect of caffeine on Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression by human adipose tissue primary culture. For that purpose, human subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained from healthy non-obese women (BMI: 26.7 +/- 2.2 kg/m(2)) after abdominal dermolipectomy, was split into explants and cultured for 6 hours with or without caffeine. Three different concentrations of caffeine were tested (0.5 mu g/mL, 5 mu g/mL and 50 mu g/mL). After 6 hours of treatment, explants were subjected to collagenase digestion in order to isolate adipocytes and SVF cells. Then, TNF alpha and IL-6 mRNA were analysed by real-time PCR alternatively in adipocytes and SVF cells. In parallel, we checked gene expression of markers involved in adipocyte differenciation and in SVF cells inflammation and proliferation. Our findings show a strong and dose dependent down-regulation of TNF-alpha gene expression in both adipocyte and SVF cells whereas IL-6 was only down regulated in SVF cells. No effect of caffeine was noticed on the other genes studied. Thus, caffeine, by decreasing TNF alpha expression, could improve adipose tissue inflammation during obesity.

AB Background: In several short-term studies, coffee consumption has been associated with impairment of endothelial function.
   Objective: The objective was to assess the relation between long-term caffeinated and decaffeinated filtered coffee consumption and markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.
   Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 730 healthy women and 663 women with type 2 diabetes from the Nurses' Health Study I cohort, who were aged 43-70 y and free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at the time blood was drawn (1989-1990). Dietary intake was assessed with a validated food-frequency questionnaire in 1986 and 1990.
   Results: About 77% of the healthy women consumed >= 1 cup (237 mL) caffeinated coffee/mo and 75% consumed >= 1 cup decaffeinated coffee/mo; the corresponding intakes for women with type 2 diabetes were 74% and 63%, respectively. In healthy women, no appreciable differences in plasma concentrations of the markers were found across categories of caffeinated coffee intake. In women with type 2 diabetes, higher caffeinated coffee consumption was associated with lower plasma concentrations of E-selectin (adjusted percentage change per I cup/d increment = -3.2%; P = 0.05) and C-reactive protein (adjusted percentage change = -10.2%; P < 0.001). Higher decaffeinated coffee consumption was associated with lower plasma concentrations of E-selectin (adjusted percentage change = -2.5%; P = 0.08) and C-reactive protein (adjusted percentage change = -7.9%; P = 0.02) only in healthy women. The results were similar when we also adjusted the models for other dietary factors and blood lipids and when we excluded participants with hypertension or hypercholesterolemia.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that neither caffeinated nor decaffeinated filtered coffee has a detrimental effect on endothelial function. In contrast, the results suggest that coffee consumption is inversely associated with markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

AB 1. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the consumption of an acute dose of caffeine and Ma Huang increases resting energy expenditure (REE), heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) over a 3 h period.
   2. A randomized, double-blind cross-over study was performed evaluating the acute effects of caffeine (150 mg)/herbal ephedra (Ma Huang; 20 mg ephedra alkaloids) versus a placebo. A total of eight healthy subjects (four males and four females) with a mean (+/-SD) age of 23.4 +/- 0.8 years (mean ages for males and females: 25.3 +/- 0.7 and 22.0 +/- 0.7 years, respectively) and 22.5 +/- 3.1% body fat (15.7 +/- 1.2 and 27.6 +/- 3.5% body fat for males and females, respectively) were recruited to the study. Participants were moderate caffeine users (approximately 150-300 mg/day).
   3. Subjects reported to the laboratory following a 12 h fast and 48 h of a caffeine-free diet. Resting energy expenditure was measured prior to supplementation and for 15 min every 30 min for 3 h following supplementation. Heart rate and BP were obtained every 15 min. Blood samples were obtained every 30 min following the measurement of REE and analysed for caffeine, ephedrine, free fatty acids and glucose.
   4. By 3 h, HR was 22.7 +/- 5.5% higher (P < 0.05) than baseline for the caffeine/ephedra trial compared with 8.9 +/- 2.2% higher for the placebo grou. At 3 h, systolic BP was 9.1 +/- 2.2% higher (P < 0.05) than baseline for the caffeine/ephedra trial compared with only 1.9 +/- 2.9% different from baseline for the placebo trial. There was no effect of the caffeine/ephedra combination on diastolic BP. Resting energy expenditure during the last 30 min was 4.5 +/- 2.5% higher in the placebo trial and 10.7 +/- 2.5% higher (P < 0.05) in the caffeine/ephedra trial; REE was 8.5 +/- 2.0% higher (P < 0.05) in the caffeine/ephedra trial compared with the placebo trial. Free fatty acids increased over time in the placebo and caffeine/ephedra trials (from 0.5 +/- 0.05 to 0.63 +/- 0.05 mEq/L and from 0.48 +/- 0.06L to 0.8 +/- 0.05 mEq/L, respectively).
   5. Caffeine and herbal ephedra, at doses of 150 mg and 20 mg (ephedrine), respectively, result in a significant elevation in REE, HR and BP. Although significant, the increase in energy expenditure is negligible in terms of weight loss.

AB Background: Caffeine ingestion decreases the insulin sensitivity index (ISI) for an oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) and decreases insulin-induced glucose disposal in lean mate subjects during a hyperinsulinemic clamp.
   Objective: We examined the effects of caffeine ingestion on insulin and glucose homeostasis in obese men before and after a nutrition and exercise intervention.
   Design: Nine sedentary, obese [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 34.0 +/- 1.0] men who had refrained from exercise and caffeine ingestion for 48 h underwent 2 oral-glucose-tolerance tests (OGTTs). The subjects randomly received caffeine (5 mg/kg) or placebo I h before each OGTT. After a 12-wk nutrition and exercise intervention, during which time the subjects avoided dietary caffeine, the OGTTs were repeated.
   Results: The intervention resulted in decreases (P less than or equal to 0.05) in body weight (8.5 +/- 1.5 kg), percentage body fat (2.8 +/- 0.7%), and fasting glucose, insulin, and proinsulin concentrations and increases in the ISI for the placebo OGTT (P less than or equal to 0.05). Caffeine caused a greater (P less than or equal to 0.05) OGTT insulin response and a lower (P less than or equal to 0.05) ISI both before and after weight loss. The proinsulin-insulin ratio indicated that neither weight loss nor caffeine affected the nature of the beta cell secretion of insulin.
   Conclusions: A nutrition and exercise intervention improved, whereas caffeine ingestion impaired, insulin-glucose homeostasis in obese men. The results are consistent with previous findings that caffeine ingestion contributes to insulin resistance.

AB Green tea may stimulate energy metabolism; however, it is unclear if acute effects are caused by specific catechins, caffeine or their combination. The objective of the present study was to examine the separate and combined effects of different catechins and caffeine on energy expenditure (EE) and fat oxidation over a single day. Fifteen healthy, normal-weight males received capsules containing placebo, caffeine alone (150mg), or caffeine plus a catechin mixture (600 mg) enriched in either epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin or a mix of catechins, in a randomised cross-over double-blinded design. On each test day EE, respiratory quotient (RQ) and substrate oxidation were measured under sedentary conditions in a respiratory chamber for 13.5h. We found no significant treatment effect on EE (P=0.20) or RQ (P=0.68). EGCG with caffeine insignificantly raised EE and fat oxidation v. caffeine-only and placebo (EE 5.71 (SE 0.12) v. 5.68 (SE, 0.14) v. 5.59 (SE 0.13) MJ/12.5h, respectively; fat oxidation 84.8 (SE, 5.2) v. 80.7 (SE 4.7) v. 76.8 (SE 4.0) g/12.5h). Catechin/caffeine combinations at these dosages and mode of application had non-significant acute effects on EE and fat oxidation. The maximum observed effect on EE of about 2 % could still be meaningful for energy balance over much longer period of exposure. However, higher short-term effects reported in the literature may reflect variations in green tea extracts, added caffeine, or synergies with physical activity. The specific mechanisms and conditions that may underpin observed longer-term benefits of catechin-enriched green tea consumption on body composition remain to be confirmed.

AB Objective: With an increase in the incidence of obesity, tremendous effort has been devoted to the development of weight loss agents and the prospective surrogate markers of both a product's efficacy and safety. The objective of the present study was to compare the pharmacodynamic responses of ephedrine and sibutramine using surrogate markers of weight loss potential and potential adverse events. Design and subjects: The study was designed as a 5-way, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with 3 single doses of ephedrine sulfate (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg x kg(-1)) followed by an open-labeled sibutramine (10 mg) treatment. Healthy, mildly overweight (BMI = 25) subjects were administered the respective treatment and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements (body surface temperature, resting metabolic rate, blood pressure, heart rate, glucose, glycerol, nonesterified fatty acids, triglycerides) were obtained for 8 hours post dose and for an additional 4 measurements during the sibutramine treatment period. Results: Sibutramine treatment significantly increased resting metabolic rate compared to the placebo condition. Ephedrine significantly increased heart rate, systolic blood pressure and glucose but did not significantly affect other measurements. Conclusion: Both sibutramine and ephedrine have been shown to have weight loss potential, however, they elicit different metabolic and biochemical responses after a single dose. The nontherapeutic responses from these types of compounds may serve as a screening tool for the development of agents in the treatment of obesity.

AB Objective: To examine joint associations of coffee consumption and other factors ( including physical activity, obesity and alcohol consumption) with the risk of type 2 diabetes.
   Design: Prospective follow-up study.
   Subjects: In all, 10188 Finnish men and 11197 women aged 35-74 years without a history of stroke, coronary heart disease or diabetes at baseline.
   Measurement: A self-administered questionnaire data on coffee, tea, alcohol and other food consumption, physical activity, smoking, socio-economic factors and medical history, together with measured height, weight and blood pressure using standardized protocol.
   Results: During a mean follow-up of 13.4 years, there were 964 incident cases of type 2 diabetes. Multivariate-adjusted (age, study year, systolic blood pressure, education, smoking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and fruit, vegetable, sausage, bread, alcohol and tea consumption) hazard ratio of type 2 diabetes in participants who drank 0-2, 3-6 and >= 7 cups of coffee were 1.00, 0.77 and 0.66 (P = 0.022 for trend) in men, 1.00, 0.71 and 0.52 (P = 0.001 for trend) in women, and 1.00, 0.75 and 0.61 (P < 0.001 for trend) in men and women combined (adjusted also for sex), respectively. This inverse association was consistent in subjects with any joint levels of physical activity and BMI, and in alcohol drinkers and non-drinkers. Among obese and inactive people, coffee drinking of seven cups or more daily reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes to half.
   Conclusions: Coffee drinking was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes in both men and women, and this association was observed regardless of the levels of physical activity, BMI and alcohol consumption.

AB Objective: This study examined the acute effects of ingesting a widely used commercial formula containing extracts of bitter orange, green tea and guarana (Gx) on the metabolic rate and substrate utilisation in overweight, adult males at rest (study 1) and during treadmill walking (study 2).
   Subjects: Two different groups of 10 sedentary males with more than 20% body fat participated in studies 1 and 2.
   Design: In each study, subjects participated in two experimental trials during which they were given two 500mg capsules containing either Gx or a placebo (P) in a counterbalanced double-blind manner. Doses of the main active ingredients were 6mg of synephrine, 150mg caffeine and 150mg catechin polyphenols.
   Measurements: In study 1, subjects completed 7 h supine rest with baseline measures taken during the first hour, with expired gases, blood pressure, heart rate and venous blood being collected every 30 min for the remaining 6 h following ingestion of Gx or P. In study 2, subjects exercised for 60 min at 60% heart rate reserve following ingestion of Gx or P 1 h previously. Venous blood samples were collected twice at rest and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min, with expired gas measurements taken at 4, 9, 14, 19, 29, 39, 49 and 59 min. In both studies, venous blood was analysed for NEFA, glycerol, glucose and lactate concentrations, while expired gases were used to calculate ATP production from carbohydrate and NEFA, as well as the total substrate utilised.
   Results and conclusion: The results did not show any significant effect of Gx ingestion on total ATP utilisation during 6 h rest or during 60 min treadmill walking. Changes were observed in the relative contributions of CHO and NEFA oxidation to ATP production in both studies, such that there was an increase in ATP production from CHO and a decrease from NEFA. The increase in CHO oxidation was shown to be as high as 30% at rest.

   REDUCTION; CHITOSAN; EFFICACY; GLUCOSE; EPHEDRA
AB Over-the-counter dietary supplements to treat obesity appeal to many patients who desire a "magic bullet" for weight loss. Asking overweight patients about their use of weight-loss supplements and understanding the evidence for the efficacy, safety, and quality of these supplements are critical when counseling patients regarding weight loss. A schema for whether physicians should recommend, caution, or discourage use of a particular weight-loss supplement is presented in this article. More than 50 individual dietary supplements and more than 125 commercial combination products are available for weight loss. Currently, no weight-loss supplements meet criteria for recommended use. Although evidence of modest weight loss secondary to ephedra-caffeine ingestion exists, potentially serious adverse effects have led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban the sale of these products. Chromium is a popular weight-loss supplement, but its efficacy and long-term safety are uncertain. Guar gum and chitosan appear to be ineffective; therefore, use of these products should be discouraged. Because of insufficient or conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of conjugated linoleic acid, ginseng, glucomannan, green tea, hydroxycitric acid, L-carnitine, psyllium, pyruvate, and St. John's wort in weight loss, physicians should caution patients about the use of these supplements and closely monitor those who choose to use these products.

AB Overeating in industrial societies is a significant problem, linked to an increasing incidence of overweight and obesity, and the resultant adverse health consequences. We advance the hypothesis that a possible explanation for overeating is that processed foods with high concentrations of sugar and other refined sweeteners, refined carbohydrates, fat, salt, and caffeine are addictive substances. Therefore, many people lose control over their ability to regulate their consumption of such foods. The loss of control over these foods could account for the global epidemic of obesity and other metabolic disorders. We assert that overeating can be described as an addiction to refined foods that conforms to the DSM-IV criteria for substance use disorders. To examine the hypothesis, we relied on experience with self-identified refined foods addicts, as well as critical reading of the literature on obesity, eating behavior, and drug addiction. Reports by self-identified food addicts illustrate behaviors that conform to the 7 DSM-IV criteria for substance use disorders. The literature also supports use of the DSM-IV criteria to describe overeating as a substance use disorder. The observational and empirical data strengthen the hypothesis that certain refined food consumption behaviors meet the criteria for substance use disorders, not unlike tobacco and alcohol. This hypothesis could lead to a new diagnostic category, as well as therapeutic approaches to changing overeating behaviors. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the regulatory effects of structural differences among methylxanthine derivatives on the elevation of body fat percentage in developmental-stage rats. Caffeine, theophylline and theobromine were used as the methylxanthines. High-fat diets (20% lard) containing each methylxanthine (0.025%) were administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks, with the result that the body fat percentage was generally reduced in each methylxanthine-fed group. The abdo minal adipose tissue weight in the caffeine group was also significantly lower than that in the control group, the serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the caffeine group also being significantly lower than the levels in the control group. The study results suggest that caffeine could contribute most to preventing arteriosclerotic diseases.

AB Researchers have long been investigating strategies that can increase athletes' ability to oxidize fatty acids and spare carbohydrate, thus potentially improving endurance capacity. Green-tea extract (epigallocatechin-3-gallate; EGCG) has been shown to improve endurance capacity in mice. If a green-tea extract can stimulate fat oxidation and as a result spare glycogen stores, then athletes may benefit through improved endurance performance. Eight male cyclists completed a study incorporating a 3-way crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, diet-controlled research design. All participants received 3 different treatments (placebo 270 mg, EGCG 270 mg, and placebo 270 mg + caffeine 3 mg/kg) over a 6-day period and 1 hr before exercise testing. Each participant completed 3 exercise trials consisting of 60 min of cycling at 60% maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) immediately followed by a self-paced 40-km cycling time trial. The study found little benefit in consuming green-tea extract on fat oxidation or cycling performance, unlike caffeine, which did benefit cycling performance. The physiological responses observed during submaximal cycling after caffeine ingestion were similar to those reported previously, including an increase in heart rate (EGCG 147 +/- 17, caffeine 146 +/- 19, and placebo 144 +/- 15 beats/min), glucose at the 40-min exercise time point (placebo 5.0 +/- 0.8, EGCG 5.4 +/- 1.0, and caffeine 5.8 +/- 1.0 mmo/L), and resting plasma free fatty acids and no change in the amount of carbohydrate and fat being oxidized. Therefore, it was concluded that green-tea extract offers no additional benefit to cyclists over and above those achieved by using caffeine.

AB The consumption of energy drinks containing sucrose and caffeine is increasing worldwide. Ten healthy women aged 18 to 22 years and fasted overnight were randomly allocated to a standardised dose of sucrose either as an "energy" drink (containing sucrose and caffeine) or lemonade on the first day and then crossed over to the alternative drink on a second day. For thirty minutes before and thirty minutes after drinking oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured in the resting subject breath-by-breath by indirect calorimetry and the rates of carbohydrate and fat oxidation calculated. Energy drink consumption apparently caused increased carbohydrate oxidation (P = 0.004) and reduced lipid oxidation (P = 0.004) compared to lemonade. The longer term effects of combined caffeine and sucrose intake, particularly in sedentary individuals, on metabolism and body fatness needs further examination.

ID WEIGHT; CONSUMPTION; SUCROSE; FAT
AB Aim In the Copenhagen Male Study sugar intake in coffee or tea is inversely associated with obesity. We analyzed the association of sugar intake with obesity among men with and without lifestyle factors indicating health awareness.
   Methods A cross-sectional study of 3,290 men aged 53-75 years including information about smoking, alcohol, physical activity, tea and coffee use, avoidance of fatty food, social class, self-assessed health, and family obesity.
   Results Overall, 291 men (8.8%) were obese, body mass index >= 30. Among men using sugar in coffee or tea (36%), the prevalence was 6.2%; among others, 10.3% (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.6 [0.4-0.8]). An inverse association between use of sugar in hot beverages and prevalence of obesity was consistent in subgroups, and most pronounced among the least health-conscious [odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.4 [0.2-0.8]).
   Interpretation The results indicate a weight-controlling or reducing effect of small amounts of sucrose ingested several times a day.

AB Background: This study investigated the antiobesity effects of TEAVIGO(TM), a product providing the most abundant green tea catechin, epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG), in a pure form. Two models of diet-induced obesity and an in vitro adipocyte differentiation assay were employed. Methods: Prevention and regression of diet-induced obesity by dietary supplementation with EGCG was studied in C57BL/6J mice and Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively. Expression of genes regulating lipid metabolism was assessed in adipose tissue. The effects of EGCG on adipocyte differentiation were investigated in vitro. Results: In C57BL/6J mice, EGCG supplementation prevented diet-induced increases in body weight and in fed state plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides, and leptin. EGCG decreased subcutaneous and epididymal adipose tissue weights. Supplementation of EGCG reversed the established obesity in Sprague-Dawley rats. Fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 mRNA levels were markedly decreased in adipose tissue of EGCG-supplemented mice. EGCG dose dependently inhibited adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Conclusion: This study shows for the first time that supplementation with the most abundant green tea polyphenol, EGCG, abolishes diet-induced obesity. This effect is at least partly mediated via a direct influence on adipose tissue. Thus, dietary supplementation with EGCG should be considered as a valuable natural treatment option for obesity.

AB The anti-obesity effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), orange peel extract (OPE), black tea extract (BTE), and caffeine (CF) in female CF-1 mice were studied. Female CF-1 mice were fed high-fat diets containing 0.1% EGCG, 0.2% OPE, 0.2% BTE and 0.05% caffeine alone and in combination for 10 weeks. The body weight gain and weights of abdominal fat and brown adipose tissue were significantly reduced in mice whose diets contained OPE, BTE, caffeine, OPE + BTE and OPE + CF. Notably, mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented daily with 0.2% OPE + 0.2% BTE + 0.05% CF prevented body weight gain by 48.8%, parametrial fat pad weight by 88.2%, retroperitoneal fat pad weight by 82.8% and brown adipose tissue by 63.7% compared with mice fed a high-fat diet. On the basis of these findings, it was concluded that oral feeding of orange peel extract, black tea extract and caffeine had anti-obesity effects by suppressing body weight gain and adipose tissue formation.

AB Introduction. Different outcomes of the effect of green tea on weight loss (WL) and weight maintenance (WM) have been reported in studies with subjects differing in ethnicity and habitual caffeine intake.
   Purpose. To elucidate by meta-analysis whether green tea indeed has a function in body weight regulation.
   Methods. English-language studies about WL and WM after green tea supplementation were identified through PubMed and based on the references from retrieved articles. Out of the 49 studies initially identified, a total of 11 articles fitted the inclusion criteria and provided useful information for the meta-analysis. Effect sizes (mean weight change in treatment versus control group) were computed and aggregated based on a random-effects model. The influence of several moderators on the effect sizes was examined.
   Results. Catechins significantly decreased body weight and significantly maintained body weight after a period of WL ((mu) over cap = -1.31 kg; P < 0.001). Inhibition of this effect by high habitual caffeine intake (> 300 mg per day) failed to reach significance ((mu) over cap = -0.27 kg for high and (mu) over cap = -1.60 kg for low habitual caffeine intake; P = 0.09). Also, the seemingly smaller effect of catechins in Caucasian ((mu) over cap = -0.82 kg) subjects compared with Asians ((mu) over cap = -1.51 kg; P = 0.37) did not reach significance. Interaction of ethnicity and caffeine intake was a significant moderator (P = 0.04).
   Conclusions. Catechins or an epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)-caffeine mixture have a small positive effect on WL and WM. The results suggest that habitual caffeine intake and ethnicity may be moderators, as they may influence the effect of catechins.

AB Background: Metabolic Syndrome, or Syndrome X, is characterized by a set of metabolic and lipid imbalances that greatly increases the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The syndrome is highly prevalent in the United States and worldwide, and treatments are in high demand. ProAlgaZyme, a novel and proprietary freshwater algae infusion in purified water, has been the subject of several animal studies and has demonstrated low toxicity even with chronic administration at elevated doses. The infusion has been used historically for the treatment of several inflammatory and immune disorders in humans and is considered well-tolerated. Here, the infusion is evaluated for its effects on the cardiovascular risk factors present in metabolic syndrome in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study involving 60 overweight and obese persons, ages 25-60. All participants received four daily oral doses (I fl oz) of ProAlgaZyme (N = 22) or water placebo (N = 30) for a total of 10 weeks, and were encouraged to maintain their normal levels of physical activity. Blood sampling and anthropometric measurements were taken at the beginning of the study period and after 4, 8 and 10 weeks of treatment. Eight participants did not complete the study.
   Results: ProAlgaZyme brought about statistically significant (p < 0.001) reductions in the following: weight, body fat, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein and fasting blood glucose levels, accompanied by a significant (p < 0.001) increase in HDL-cholesterol levels over the 10-week study period. The infusion was well-tolerated and no side effects were noted.
   Conclusion: ProAlgaZyme (4 fl oz daily) consumption resulted in significant reductions in weight and blood glucose levels, while significantly improving serum lipid profiles and reducing markers of inflammation, thus improving cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese subjects over a course of 10 weeks with an absence of adverse side effects.

AB Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of a green tea meal replacement formula product for the treatment of obesity.
   Design A 12-week clinical trial was performed, in which 120 (25 male, 95 female) healthy, overweight and obese persons were included (each of them occupy one-third of the whole population). The green tea formula was provided in the treatment group and normal diet was provided as control.
   Results More weight loss was found in the treatment group than the control (6.8 versus 2.3 kg; P<0.001). Also, the treatment group had a greater changes in total cholesterol (185.2 versus 215.2 mg/dl; P = 0.011) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (106.7 versus 127.6 mg/dl; P<0.005). Among completers only, the treatment group again lost more weight (6.8 kg; n = 54 versus 0.8 kg; n = 56; P = 0.001) and had a greater reduced total body fat mass (7.6%; n = 37 versus 0.5%; P = 0.005).
   Conclusions This green tea meal replacement formula contributes to the lower body weight and reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.

AB We evaluated the effects of apple polyphenol (AP), of which the major components are procyanidins, on obesity and glucose tolerance using Zucker fatty rats (fa/fa). In this study, Zucker fatty rats were fed diets containing 0.2% or 1.0% apple polyphenol for 12 weeks. Visceral fat weight and triglyceride levels in blood and liver were reduced by AP intake. Glucose and insulin levels in blood also decreased, and the amount of fatty acids excreted into feces increased in dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, suppression of fatty acid synthase gene expression in the liver and increase of adiponectin gene expression in white adipose tissues were observed. These results indicate that AP improves lipid metabolism and insulin resistance.

AB Although the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Australia has increased during the past 30 years, little is known about the dietary and behavioural antecedents of body mass index (BMI). We examined changes in mean BMI, diet, and other lifestyle behaviours between 1976 and 2005 and described the cross-sectional associations between these factors and BMI. A series of biennial biomedical surveys by Sydney Adventist Hospital from 1976 to 2005 allowed examination of BMI trends, while the selection of three surveys enabled detailed examination of likely dietary and lifestyle associations. Subjects included in this study were: 384 men and 338 women in 1976: 160 men and 146 women in 1978; 166 men and 141 women in 1980. 164 men and 142 women in 1982; 177 men and 13 women in 1984; 239 men and 227 women in 1986; 210 men and 225 women in 1988; 165 men and 148 women in 1990; 138 men and 167 women in 1992 and 270 men and 62 women in 2005. Height and weight were measured by hospital staff. Mean BMI increased in the early 1990s. Salt, coffee, cola.. alcohol and meat consumption, dieting to lose weight and eating between meals were positively associated with BMI while physical activity, food variety, large breakfasts and consumption of spreads were negatively associated. Food consumption and daily activities have important associations with BMI, though their specific associations differ by sex. "Affluent" lifestyle patterns appear to contribute to higher BMI, while a more "prudent" lifestyle seems to protect from such increases.

AB Objectives: The development of obesity is characterized by an increase in adipose tissue mass and by concomitant and profound changes in almost all organ functions leading to diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. Recent data from human studies indicate that the consumption of green tea and green tea extracts may help reduce body weight, mainly body fat, by increasing postprandial thermogenesis and fat oxidation. However, human studies investigating the metabolic effects of the most predominant tea catechin, EGCG, alone are absent.
   Methods: In a randomized double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot study, six overweight men were given 300 mg EGCG/d for 2d. Fasting and postprandial changes in energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation were assessed.
   Results: Resting EE did not differ significantly between EGCG and placebo treatments, although during the first postprandial monitoring phase, respiratory quotient (RQ) values were significantly lower with EGCG compared to the placebo.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that EGCG alone has the potential to increase fat oxidation in men and may thereby contribute to the anti-obesity effects of green tea. However, more studies with a greater sample size and a broader range of age and BMI are needed to define the optimum dose.

AB Detailed research examining concurrent longitudinal and secular changes in adolescent beverage intake is not currently available, particularly since the year 2000. This study's objective was to evaluate these trends in beverage intake in a large, diverse adolescent cohort. Project EAT (Eating Among Teens)-II is a 5-year longitudinal study (n=2,516) including two cohorts, which allows for the observation of longitudinal changes from early to midadolescence (junior high to high school) and from mid- to late adolescence (high school to post high school). Project EAT-II also examined secular trends in adolescent health behavior from 1999-2004 in mid-adolescence. Daily beverage servings were assessed using the Youth and Adolescent Food Frequency Questionnaire. Longitudinal findings indicate that intake of soda and sugar-sweetened beverages (including soda, sweetened iced teas, and fruit drinks) increased significantly among younger males, and alcohol increased across all groups (P<0.01). Consumption of certain beverages decreased with age: fruit juice (among all males and older females, P <= 0.02), milk (older adolescents, P<0.01), other milk beverages (all females and older males, P<0.01), diet soda (younger adolescents, P<0.01), and coffee/tea (all males and younger females, P<0.01). Significant secular decreases were observed in fruit juice and coffee/tea for males and females (P <= 0.05). Overall, these findings reflect recent secular and longitudinal shifts in adolescent beverage consumption during the critical transition period from early to mid-adolescence and mid- to late adolescence. Although additional research is needed to better understand nuances in adolescent consumption patterns, registered dietitians and other health care practitioners working with adolescents should address the importance of limiting sugar-sweetened beverages with low nutrient density.

AB Background: Dietary flavonoids are suggested to have antiobesity effects. Prospective evidence of an association between flavonoids and body mass index (BMI) is lacking in general populations.
   Objective: We assessed this association between 3 flavonoid subgroups and BMI over a 14-y period in 4280 men and women aged 55-69 y at baseline from the Netherlands Cohort Study.
   Design: Dietary intake was estimated at baseline (1986) by a validated food-frequency questionnaire. BMI was ascertained through self-reported height (in 1986) and weight (in 1986, 1992, and 2000). Analyses were based on sex-specific quintiles for the total intake of 6 catechins and of 3 flavonols/flavones. Linear mixed effect modeling was used to assess longitudinal associations in 3 adjusted models: age only, lifestyle (age, energy intake, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, type 2 diabetes, and coffee consumption), and lifestyle and diet (vegetables, fruit, fiber, grains, sugar, dessert, and dieting habits).
   Results: After adjustment for age and confounders, the BMI(kg/m(2)) of women with the lowest intake of total flavonols/flavones and total catechins increased by 0.95 and 0.77, respectively, after 14 y. Women with the highest intake of total flavonols/flavones and total catechins experienced a significantly lower increase in BMI of 0.40 and 0.31, respectively (between group difference: P < 0.05). This difference remained after additional adjustment for dietary determinants and after stratification of median baseline BMI. In men, no significant differences in BMI change were observed over the quintiles of flavonoid intake after 14 y.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that flavonoid intake may contribute to maintaining body weight in the general female population. Am J Clin Nutr 2008; 88: 1341-52.

   TRENDS; FOODS; MEN; CONSEQUENCES
AB Gourmet coffee beverages (GCBs) are relatively new products in the foodservice industry that consist of high-energy coffee drinks. A descriptive study was conducted to evaluate the frequency of consumption of GCBs and their energy and fat contribution to overall dietary intake in college women using a beverage questionnaire and a 3-day food diary. A convenience sample of 165 undergraduate and graduate women attending Simmons College completed a beverage questionnaire, and a subsample of 41 women completed a 3-day food diary. Mean reported GCB consumption was 2.5 times/week for the entire sample and 7 times/week for the food diary subsample. A comparison of GCB consumers and nonconsumers indicated that GCB drinkers had a 206 kcal/day higher intake (P=.250) and a 32 g higher sugar intake than nonconsumers (P<.05). A significant percentage of college women consume GCBs, which contributes additional energy and fat to dietary intake. Over time, this could potentially affect weight status.

AB Background: The purpose of this placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study was to compare the effects of two commercially available soft drinks on metabolic rate.
   Methods: After giving informed consent, twenty healthy men and women were randomly assigned to ingest 12 ounces of Celsius (TM) and, on a separate day, 12 ounces of Diet Coke (R). All subjects completed both trials using a randomized, counterbalanced design. Metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory exchange ratio) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and at the end of each hour for 3 hours post-ingestion.
   Results: Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant interaction (p < 0.001) between trials in metabolic rate. Scheffe post-hoc testing indicated that metabolic rate increased by 13.8% (+ 0.6 L/min, p < 0.001) 1 hr post, 14.4% (+ 0.63 L/min, p < 0.001) 2 hr post, and 8.5% (+ 0.37 L/min, p < 0.004) 3 hr post Celsius (TM) ingestion. In contrast, small (similar to 4-6%) but statistically insignificant increases in metabolic rate were noted following Diet Coke (R) ingestion. No differences in respiratory exchange ratio were noted between trials.
   Conclusion: These preliminary findings indicate Celsius (TM) has thermogenic properties when ingested acutely. The effects of repeated, chronic ingestion of Celsius (TM) on body composition are unknown at this time.

AB Objective: To test whether consumption of a beverage containing active ingredients will increase 24-hour energy metabolism in healthy, young, lean individuals.
   Research Method and Procedures: Thirty-one male and female subjects consumed 3 X 250-mL servings of a beverage containing green tea catechins, caffeine, and calcium for 3 days in a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study. On the 3rd day, 23-hour energy metabolism, extrapolated to 24-hour, was measured in a calorimeter chamber. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured, and total day and night urines were analyzed for urea and catecholamine excretion.
   Results: Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure (EE) and 24-hour fat oxidation were lower in women than in men (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.015, respectively). Although there were no treatment or treatment/gender effects on substrate oxidation, treatment increased 24-hour EE by 106 +/- 31 kcal/24 hours (p = 0.002), equivalent to 4.7 +/- 1.6 kcal/h (day; p = 0.005) and 3.3 +/- 1.5 kcal/h (night; p = 0.04). No significant differences were observed in hemodynamic parameters.
   Discussion: The present study provides evidence that consumption of a beverage containing green tea catechins, caffeine, and calcium increases 24-hour EE by 4.6%, but the contribution of the individual ingredients cannot be distinguished. Although this increase is modest, the results are discussed in relation to proposed public health goals, indicating that such modifications are sufficient to prevent weight gain. When consumed regularly as part of a healthy diet and exercise regime, such a beverage may provide benefits for weight control.

AB Objective: The body fat reducing effect and reduction of risks for cardiovascular disease by a green tea extract (GTE) high in catechins was investigated in humans with typical lifestyles.
   Research Methods and Procedures: Japanese women and men with visceral fat-type obesity were recruited for the trial. After a 2-week diet run-in period, a 12-week double-blind parallel multicenter trial was performed, in which the subjects ingested green tea containing 583 mg of catechins (catechin group) or 96 mg of catechins (control group) per day. Randomization was stratified by gender and body mass index at each medical institution. The subjects were instructed to maintain their usual dietary intake and normal physical activity.
   Results: Data were analyzed using per-protocol samples of 240 subjects (catechin group; n = 123, control group; n = 117). Decreases in body weight, body mass index, body fat ratio, body fat mass, waist circumference, hip circumference, visceral fat area, and subcutaneous fat area were found to be greater in the catechin group than in the control group. A greater decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found in the catechin group compared with the control group for subjects whose initial SBP was 130 mm Hg or higher. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was also decreased to a greater extent in the catechin group. No adverse effect was found.
   Discussion: The continuous ingestion of a GTE high in catechins led to a reduction in body fat, SBP, and LDL cholesterol, suggesting that the ingestion of such an extract contributes to a decrease in obesity and cardiovascular disease risks.

AB We investigated the effects of continuous ingestion of a catechin-rich beverage in patients with type 2 diabetes who were not receiving insulin (Ins) therapy in a double-blind controlled study. The participants ingested green tea containing either 582.8 mg of catechins (catechin group; n = 23) or 96.3 mg of catechins (control group; n = 20) per day for 12 weeks. At week 12, the decrease in waist circumference was significantly greater in the catechin group than in the control group. Adiponectin, which is negatively correlated with visceral adiposity, increased significantly only in the catechin group. Although the increase in Ins at week 12 was significantly greater in the catechin group than in the control group, no apparent difference was noted between the two groups in glucose and hemoglobin A(1c). In patients treated with insulinotropic agents, the increase in Ins at week 12 was significantly greater in the catechin group than in the control group. This significant increase in Ins levels was observed only in the catechin group. In the catechin group receiving other treatments, Ins levels remained unchanged. In addition, in patients treated with insulinotropic agents, the decrease in hemoglobin A(1c) at week 12 was significantly greater in the catechin group than in the control group. These results suggest that a catechin-rich beverage might have several therapeutic uses: in the prevention of obesity; in the recovery of Ins-secretory ability; and, as a way to maintain low hemoglobin A(1c) levels in type 2 diabetic patients who do not yet require Ins therapy.

AB Increases in overweight and obesity have been observed globally in both developed and developing countries. The authors assessed the relation between lifestyle factors and body mass index (BMI) (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) in a population-based longitudinal study, using BMI and its subsequent change as responses in a multilevel model. The authors included 11,115 men and women aged 20-61 years at baseline who were living in the municipality of Tromso, Norway, and who participated in three or four consecutive health surveys between 1979-1980 and 2001. Baseline age, physical activity at work, coffee consumption, and desired BMI (i.e., the BMI that the subjects reported they would like to have) were positively associated with baseline BMI, whereas height, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity, and level of education were inversely associated. Most relations were found to be stronger in women than in men. Clinically relevant effect sizes were observed for most of the significant associations, especially in women. For instance, on an ordinal scale, a one-category increase in educational level would decrease the mean baseline BMI among women by 0.30 kg/m(2). Significant associations between several lifestyle factors and subsequent BMI change revealed that observed baseline associations were strengthened over time, especially in women.

   Methods: Healthy college-aged male (23.2 +/- 4.0 y, 177.2 +/- 6.1 cm, 81.7 +/- 11.3 kg, 22.8 +/- 7.3% fat; n = 30) and female (23.4 +/- 3.1 y, 165.6 +/- 8.7 cm, 62.1 +/- 9.9 kg, 28.3 +/- 7.4% fat; n = 30) participants were matched according to height and weight to consume 336 ml of the TD or a non-caloric, non-caffeinated placebo (PLA). After a 12 h fast, participants reported for pre-consumption measures of height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, resting energy expenditure (REE), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), glycerol and free-fatty acid (FFA) concentrations. REE and RER were determined at 60, 120, and 180 min post-consumption. Serum glycerol and FFA concentrations were determined at 30, 60, 120 and 180 min post-consumption.
   Results: When compared to PLA, TD significantly increased REE at 60, 120 and 180 min (p < 0.05). FFA concentrations were significantly greater in TD compared to PLA at 30, 60, 120 and 180 min post-consumption (p < 0.05). No between-group differences were found in RER.
   Conclusion: Acute TD ingestion significantly increased REE, FFA and glycerol appearance. If sustained, these changes may help to promote weight loss and improve body composition; however, these findings are currently unknown as are the general safety and efficacy of prolonged consumption.

AB Plasma NEFA (non-esterified fatty acid) concentrations are elevated in patients with obesity. In the present study we first aimed to provide an integral haemodynamic profile of elevated plasma NEFAs by the simultaneous assessment of blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, FBF (forearm blood flow) and sympathetic nervous system activity during acute elevation of NEFAs. Secondly, we hypothesized that NEFA-induced vasodilation is mediated by adenosine receptor stimulation. In a randomized cross-over trial in healthy subjects, Intralipid((R)) was infused for 2 h to elevate plasma NEFAs. Glycerol was administered as the Control infusion. We assessed blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, FBF (using venous occlusion plethysmography) and sympathetic nervous system activity by measurement of noradrenaline and adrenaline. During the last 15 min of Intralipid((R))/Control infusion, the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine (90 mu g . min(-1) . dl(-1)) was administered into the brachial artery of the non-dominant arm. Compared with Control infusion, lntralipid((R))) increased pulse wave velocity, SBP (systolic blood pressure) and pulse pressure, as well as FBF (from 1.8 +/- 0.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.6 and from 2.3 +/- 0.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.6 ml . min-1 . dl(-1) for Intralipid((R)) compared with Control infusion; P < 0.05, n = 9). Although in a positive control study caffeine attenuated adenosine-induced forearm vasodilation (P < 0.0 1, n = 6), caffeine had no effect on Intralipid((R))-induced vasodilation (P = 0.5). In conclusion, elevation of plasma NEFA levels increased pulse wave velocity, SBP and pulse pressure. FBF was also increased, either by baroreflex-mediated inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system or by a direct vasodilating effect of NEFAs. As the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine could not antagonize the vasodilator response, this response is not mediated by adenosine receptor stimulation.

AB Obesity is a major health problem facing the developed and developing world. Efforts by individuals, health professionals, educators, and policy makers to combat the escalating trend of growing obesity prevalence have been multifaceted and mixed in outcome. Various dietary supplements have been marketed to reduce obesity. These products have been suggested to accomplish this by decreasing energy intake and energy absorption, and/or increasing metabolic rate. Ephedra, one such supplement, was banned from sale in the US market because of concerns about adverse events. Another substance, Citrus aurantium, which contains several compounds including synephrine alkaloids, has been suggested as a safe alternative. This review examines the evidence for safety and efficacy of C. aurantium and synephrine alkaloids as examined in animal studies, clinical weight loss trials, acute physiologic studies and case reports. Although at least three reviews of C. aurantium have been published, our review expands upon these by: (i) distinguishing and evaluating the efficacy of C. aurantium and related compounds; (ii) including results from previously unreviewed research; (iii) incorporating recent case reports that serve to highlight, in an anecdotal way, potential adverse events related to the use of C. aurantium and related compounds; and (iv) offering recommendations to guide the design of future trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of C. aurantium. While some evidence is promising, we conclude that larger and more rigorous clinical trials are necessary to draw adequate conclusions regarding the safety and efficacy of C. aurantium and synephrine alkaloids for promoting weight loss.

AB Objective.. To examine the effect of Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) membership on 'immunity' to the secular effects of changes in BMI.
   Design: Three independent, cross-sectional, screening surveys conducted by Sydney Adventist Hospital in 1976, 1986 and 1988 and a survey conducted among residents of Melbourne in 2006.
   Subjects: Two hundred and fifty-two SDA and 464 non-SDA in 1976; 166 SDA and 291 non-SDA in 1986; 120 SDA and 300-non SDA in 1988; and 251 SDA and 294 non-SDA in 2006.
   Measurements: Height and weight measured by hospital staff in 1976, 1986 and 1988; self-reported by respondents in 2006.
   Results: The mean BMI of non-SDA men increased between 1986 and 2006 (P< 0-001) but did not change for SDA men or non-SDA women. Despite small increases in SDA women's mean BMI (P= 0-030) between 1988 and 2006, this was no different to that of SDA men and non-SDA women in 2006. The diet and eating patterns of SDA men and women were more 'prudent' than those of non-SDA men and women, including more fruit, vegetables, grains, nuts and legumes, and less alcohol, meat, sweetened drinks and coffee. Many of these factors were found to be predictors of lower BMI.
   Conclusion: The 'prudent' dietary and lifestyle prescriptions of SDA men appear to have 'immunised' them to the secular effects of changes that occurred among non-SDA men's BMI. The dietary and lifestyle trends of SDA women did not reflect the increase in their BMI observed in 2006

AB Intake in the morning is associated with a reduction in the total intake for the day, while intake at night is associated with greater overall daily intake. These associations are macronutrient specific, with morning carbohydrate intake associated with reduced daily carbohydrate intake, morning fat intake associated with reduced daily fat intake and morning protein intake associated with reduced daily protein intake. Since different types of foods contain differing proportions of macronutrients, the present study investigated the associations of different types of foods ingested at various times of day with total daily and macronutrient intakes. The intakes of 388 male and 621 female free-living individuals reported in 7d diet diaries were reanalysed. The intakes of twenty-four different types of foods and seven different drinks occurring during the morning (04.00-10.29 hours), afternoon (10.30-16.59 hours) and evening (17.00-02.00 hours) were identified and related to overall daily intakes. Dairy foods, ice cream, beef, other meats, potatoes, pastry, nuts, chips and snacks, condiments, alcohol and soda were significantly associated with higher total intake over the day, while fruit, soup, breakfast cereal, pasta, pizza, water, coffee/tea and diet soda were either not associated or were associated with lower overall intake. Dietary energy density appeared to mediate the associations between particular foods and beverages and overall energy intake. This suggests that eating low-density foods in the morning and avoiding high-density foods at night might aid in reducing overall intake and may be useful in dietary interventions for overweight and obesity.

AB Although it is widely believed that type 2 diabetes mellitus is the result of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, compelling evidence from epidemiologic studies indicates that the current worldwide diabetes epidemic is largely due to changes in diet and lifestyle. Prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that type 2 diabetes can be prevented largely through moderate diet and lifestyle modifications. Excess adiposity is the most important risk factor for diabetes, and thus, maintaining a healthy body weight and avoiding weight gain during adulthood is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention. Increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviors such as prolonged TV watching are important both for maintaining body weight and improving insulin sensitivity. There is increasing evidence that the quality of fat and carbohydrate plays a more important role than does the quantity, and thus, public health strategies should emphasize replacing saturated and trans fats with unsaturated fats and replacing refined grain products with whole grains. Recent studies have also suggested a potential role for coffee, dairy, nuts, magnesium, and calcium in preventing diabetes. Overall, a healthy diet, together with regular physical activity, maintenance of a healthy weight, moderate alcohol consumption, and avoidance of sedentary behaviors and smoking, could nearly eliminate type 2 diabetes. However, there is still a wide gap between what we know and what we practice in the field of public health; how to narrow that gap remains a major public health challenge.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effect of a dietary supplement containing herbal caffeine (70 mg/dose) and ephedra (24 mg/dose; C&E) on metabolic rate, weight loss, body composition, and safety parameters.
   Research Methods and Procedures: In phase 1, 12 healthy subjects with a BMI of 25 to 35 kg/m 2 had resting metabolic rate (RMR) measured for 2 hours after ingesting C&E or a placebo on two occasions I week apart, followed by a 1-week washout before phase II. In phase 11, these 12 and 28 additional subjects were randomized to a 12-week, double-blind trial comparing C&E (3 times/day) to placebo. In phase III, the C&E group was given open-label C&E for 3 months, and the placebo group was given C&E for 6 months.
   Results: In phase 1, C&E gave an average 8 +/- 0.1% (SE) rise, in RMR over 2 hours compared with placebo (p < 0.01). In phase 11, weight loss at 12 weeks was 3.5 +/- 0.6 kg with C&E compared with 0.8 +/- 0.5 kg with placebo (p < 0.02). The percentage fat lost, shown by DXA, was 7.9 +/- 2.9% with C&E and 1.9 +/- 1.1% with placebo (p < 0.05). Pulse decreased more. in the placebo group that in the CE group (p < 0.03). There were no differences in lipid levels or blood pressure. In phase 111, there was a 6-month loss of 7.3% and 7.8% of initial body weight for the groups on placebo and C&E during phase 11, respectively. There were no serious adverse events.
   Discussion: C&E increased RMR significantly by 8% compared with placebo, promoted more weight and fat loss than placebo, and was well tolerated.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of composite extracts in reducing weight, as the main outcome measure. Secondary measures of the study were body composition change. Design: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting: Tertiary university clinic. Subjects: hundred and five subjects, 5 of them withdrawn consent, 2 drop-outs not related to study preparation. Intervention: two tablet per meal concept supposed to generate a "psychological" therapy-like approach during 12 weeks supported by measured physical activity. The tablets 1 (one hour before meals, comprises extracts of Asparagus, Green tea, Black tea, Guarana, Mate and Kidney beans) and 2 (taken half an hour after meals, comprises extracts of Kidney bean pods, Garcinia cambogia, and Chromium yeast) are taken twice daily with two main meals. Results: A significant change of the Body Composition Improvement Index (BCI) was observed in the active extract group compared to placebo (p = 0.012). Weight, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio was not statistically different between groups. Body fat loss was greater in active group (p = 0.011) compared to placebo. A weight loss parameter corrected for exercise was introduced and found to be higher in active group (p = 0.046) than in placebo, meaning that the formula was more efficacious, due to a concurrently performed exercise program - a recommended strategy for life style modification. Conclusions: A significant change of the Body Composition Improvement Index and the decrease in body fat was statistically significant in active extract subjects compared to placebo. A change in some outcome measures like: weight, BMI failed to produce significant difference between groups.

TI Dietary supplements in weight reduction

DT Article
ID BODY-WEIGHT; CALCIUM INTAKE; BONE TURNOVER; FAT LOSS; OVERWEIGHT;
   EFFICACY; SAFETY; RESTRICTION; OBESITY; ADULTS
AB We summarize evidence on the role of dietary supplements in weight reduction, with particular attention to their safety and benefits. Dietary supplements are used for two purposes in weight reduction: (a) providing nutrients that may be inadequate in calorie-restricted diets and (b) for their potential benefits in stimulating weight loss. The goal in planning weight-reduction diets is that total intake from food and supplements should meet recommended dietary allowance/adequate intake levels without greatly exceeding them for all nutrients, except energy. If nutrient amounts from food sources in the reducing diet fall short, dietary supplements containing a single nutrient/element or a multivitamin-mineral combination may be helpful. On hypocaloric diets, the addition of dietary supplements providing nutrients at a level equal to or below recommended dietary allowance/adequate intake levels or 100% daily value, as stated in a supplement's facts box on the label, may help dieters to achieve nutrient adequacy and maintain electrolyte balance while avoiding the risk of excessive nutrient intakes. Many botanical and other types of dietary supplements are purported to be useful for stimulating or enhancing weight loss. Evidence of their efficacy in stimulating weight loss is inconclusive at present. Although there are few examples of safety concerns related to products that are legal and on the market for this purpose, there is also a paucity of evidence on safety for this intended use. Ephedra and ephedrine-containing supplements, with or without caffeine, have been singled out in recent alerts from the Food and Drug Administration because of safety concerns, and use of products containing these substances cannot be recommended. Dietitians should periodically check the Food and Drug Administration Web site (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov) for updates and warnings and alert patients/clients to safety concerns. Dietetics professionals should also consult authoritative sources for new data on efficacy as it becomes available (ods.od.nih.gov).

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between eating food purchased away from home (FAH) and longitudinal change in body mass index (BMI) z-score among girls, and to assess the longitudinal tracking of eating FAH from childhood through adolescence.
   DESIGN: Participants kept 7-day dietary records at two points in time. The records included the place and time for all foods consumed. We recorded how often participants ate FAH, calculated the percent of total energy derived from FAH, and classified foods as quick-service food, coffee-shop food, or restaurant food.
   PARTICIPANTS: Healthy girls (n = 101) between the ages of 8 and 12 y at baseline and 11 and 19 y at follow-up participated in a longitudinal study of growth and development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Analysis of variance was used to assess the relationship between change in BMI z-score and both the frequency of eating FAH and energy derived from eating FAH. The participants' baseline BMI z-score was a significant covariate and was controlled for in both models. We used the kappa coefficient to assess FAH tracking from childhood through adolescence.
   RESULTS: The frequency of eating quick-service food at baseline was positively associated with change in BMI z-score (F = 6.49, P < 0.01). Participants who ate quick-service food twice a week or more at baseline had the greatest mean increase in BMI z-score compared to those who ate quick-service food once a week or not at all. Quick-service food eating tracked slightly from childhood through adolescence (k = 0.17, P < 0.05).
   DISCUSSION: Adolescent girls who eat quick-service food twice a week or more are likely to increase their relative BMI over time.

AB Obesity is a major health problem in the developed and developing world. Many "functional" foods and ingredients are advocated for their effects on body composition but few have consistent scientific support for their efficacy. However, an increasing amount of mechanistic and clinical evidence is building for green tea. The tea plant is naturally rich in a group of antioxidants known as catechins. Unlike black tea, green tea production involves little processing and fermentation and therefore, green tea brews are rich in catechins.
   Green tea has been suggested to have a number of potential health benefits in areas such as cardiovascular disease, cancer prevention, glucose homeostasis and dental health. Although there is some promising evidence in all of these areas, more data from human intervention trials are needed.
   A lot of attention has lately been focused on the beneficial effects of green tea on body composition and particularly visceral fat, which has been shown to have a strong link with different components of the metabolic syndrome such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Most, but not all, of the positive results come from a number Asian studies, in which overweight subjects (men and women) consumed green tea for approximately 12 weeks. Finally, green tea may also have measurable acute effects oil energy metabolism and fat oxidation and in particular during physical activity, as evidenced by other studies specifically looking at these endpoints. Small cumulative effects on energy metabolism could also be responsible for the longer-tem effects of green tea on body composition, and these long-term effects may also be most apparent in the context of moderate physical activity. However, more research is needed to further clarify the exact mechanisms of action and to extrapolate these findings to non-Asian populations.

AB Background: Obesity in adolescence has been increasing in the past several decades. Beverage habits among adolescents include increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and decreased consumption of milk.
   Objective: This study aimed to examine the association between beverage consumption and 5-y body weight change in 2294 adolescents.
   Design: Project EAT (Eating Among Teens) is a 5-y longitudinal study of eating patterns among adolescents. Surveys were completed in 1998-1999 (time 1) and in 2003-2004 (time 2). Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the association between beverage consumption at time 2 and change in body mass index from time 1 to time 2, with adjustments for age, socioeconomic status, race, cohort, physical activity, sedentary behavior, coffee, tea, time 1 body mass index, and beverage variables.
   Results: In prospective analyses, consumption of beverages was not associated with weight gain, except for consumption of low-calorie soft drinks (positive association, P = 0.002) and white milk (inverse association, P = 0.03), but these associations did not appear to be a monotonic linear dose-response relation. The positive association with low-calorie soft drinks was no longer present after adjustment for dieting and parental weight-related concerns, which suggests that the use of low-calorie soft drinks is a marker for more general dietary behaviors and weight concerns.
   Conclusions: We showed no association between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, juice consumption, and adolescent weight gain over a 5-y period. A direct association between diet beverages and weight gain appeared to be explained by dieting practices. Adolescents who consumed little or no white milk gained significantly more weight than their peers who consumed white milk. Future research that examines beverage habits and weight among adolescents should address portion sizes, adolescent maturation, and dieting behaviors. Am J Clin Nutr 2009;90:1489-95.

AB Aims
   Recent reports have called into question the safety of ephedra supplements especially with regards to their cardiovascular effects. The purpose of this analysis was to characterize, via pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling, the cardiovascular effects of ephedrine, the main active ingredient of ephedra, in apparently healthy, overweight volunteers.
   Methods
   In a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study, eight subjects received either placebo, 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 mg kg(-1) ephedrine sulphate by mouth with a 7-day washout between treatments. Plasma ephedrine concentrations, heart rate and blood pressure were determined for 8 h postdose.
   Results
   The pharmacokinetics of ephedrine were best described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The percentage change in heart rate was described by a linear model with a resulting slope of 0.14%.l mug(-1) (CV = 59%). The percentage change in systolic blood pressure demonstrated clockwise hysteresis, and a sigmoidal tolerance model was used to describe the data. The mean maximum predicted effect (E-max) was 53.7% (CV = 41%) with an EC50 of 107 mug-l(-1) (CV = 65%) and an inhibitory maximum (I-max) of 39.8% (CV = 60%). Tolerance developed with a mean half-life of 15 min (range 6-140 min).
   Conclusions
   This is the first study to apply a comprehensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to the cardiovascular effects of orally administered ephedrine. Although systolic blood pressure increases quickly after administration, the increase is nearly abolished by compensatory mechanisms.

AB Dietary intake of whole-grain foods is associated with a decreased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease. In addition to dietary fibre, various phytochemicals have been suggested to contribute to the health effects of whole grain products. This review focuses on phenolic compounds in rye (Secale cereale L.), which is one of the major bread grains in Europe. Data on phenolic concentrations in rye grain and foods, their bioavailability to tissues and effects in vivo, and their potential contributions to health are presented. Phenolic compounds in rye, such as phenolic acids, alkylresorcinols and lignans, are concentrated in the outer layers of the grain. Phenolic acids are the major phenolic compounds in whole grain rye (103-300 mg/100 g grain), ferulic acid being the most abundant. Rye lignans are present at concentrations of 2 mg/100 g grain and had been shown to be converted by the intestinal microflora to the mammalian lignans enterodiol and enterolactone in human intervention studies. Alkylresorcinols (36-320 mg/100 g grain), which have been found to be incorporated into human erythrocyte membranes, are of particular interest due to their potential use as biomarkers of the intake of rye and wheat.

AB We investigated whether regular decaffeinated green tea intake could modulate body weight in an experimental model of obesity. Male leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice and their C57BL/6J lean littermates (4 weeks of age; n 20/genotype) were assigned randomly to receive either decaffeinated green tea or vehicle, for 6 weeks. Body weights were recorded weekly and fluid intake was measured at each replacement. Blood was collected from the heart into collection tubes, with Li(+)-heparin as the anticoagulant. Administration of decaffeinated green tea to ob/ob mice significantly slowed their rate of weight gain, as compared with animals that were fed buffer alone. This effect is apparent after only 1 week of supplementation. No significant difference was recorded between C57BL/6J lean mice administrated decaffeinated green tea and those given buffer alone. Decaffeinated green tea consumption by ob/ob mice was also associated with significantly lower cholesterolemia, triglyceridemia, and adiponectin concentration. Fecal lipids did not change significantly throughout the experiment. In conclusion, administration of decaffeinated green tea might contribute to weight control and provides an opportunity for through-the-day consumption, without the excitatory effects of caffeine.

AB Apples (Malus sp., Rosaceae) are a rich source of nutrient as well as non-nutrient components and contain high levels of polyphenols and other phytochemicals. Main structural classes of apple constituents include hydroxycinnamic acids, di-hydrochalcones, flavonols (quercetin glycosides), catechins and oligomeric procyaniclins, as well as triterpenoids in apple peel and anthocyanins in red apples. Several lines of evidence suggest that apples and apple products possess a wide range of biological activities which may contribute to health beneficial effects against cardiovascular disease, asthma and pulmonary dysfunction, diabetes, obesity, and cancer (reviewed by Boyer and Liu, Nutr J 2004). The present review will summarize the current knowledge on potential cancer preventive effects of apples, apple juice and apple extracts (jointly designated as apple products). In brief, apple extracts and components, especially oligomeric procyanidins, have been shown to influence multiple mechanisms relevant for cancer prevention in in vitro studies. These include antimutagenic activity, modulation of carcinogen metabolism, antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory mechanisms, modulation of signal transduction pathways, antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activity, as well as novel mechanisms on epigenetic events and innate immunity. Apple products have been shown to prevent skin, mammary and colon carcinogenesis in animal models. Epidemiological observations indicate that regular consumption of one or more apples a day may reduce the risk for lung and colon cancer.

AB Natural phenolic acids are commonly present in plants consumed in the diet. Recently we have observed that different natural phenolic acids exert differential effects on the body mass gain in ovariectomized and non-ovariectomized female rats. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ferulic, caffeic, p-coumaric and chlorogenic acids on serum estradiol and total cholesterol levels in ovariectomized and non-ovariectomized rats. The experiments were carried out on 3-month old female Wistar Cmd:(WI)WU rats, divided into following groups (n=8 in each group): non-ovariectomized control rats and non-ovariectomized rats receiving ferulic, caffeic, p-coumaric or chlorogenic acids, sham-operated control rats, ovariectomized control rats and ovariectomized rats receiving the same phenolic acids. The phenolic acids were administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg p.o. daily for 4 weeks. Serum estradiol and total cholesterol levels on the next day after the last administration of the phenolic acids were examined. The phenolic acids did not affect serum estradiol or total cholesterol levels in non-ovariectomized rats. In ovariectomized rats, caffeic acid and to a lesser extent p-coumaric acid increased serum estradiol level, which effect correlated with a decreased body mass gain. All the phenolic acids decreased serum cholesterol level in ovariectomized rats. Concluding, the anti-obesity activity of some phenolic acids may be, at least partially, connected with estrogenic pathways.

AB OBJECTIVE - To examine trends in the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes and the proportion of total cases previously diagnosed, according to obesity status in the U.S. over the past 40 years.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We assembled data from five consecutive cross-sectional national surveys: National Health Examination Survey I (1960-1962), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I (1971-1974), NHANES II (1976-1980), NHANES III (1988-1994), and NHANES 1999-2000. Diagnosed diabetes was ascertained, and height and weight were measured in adults aged 20-74 years in all surveys. In NHANES II, NHANES III, and NHANES 1999-2000, a fasting glucose level greater than or equal to126 mg/dl was used to identify cases among individuals not reporting diabetes. Design-based analyses and Bayesian models estimate the probability that prevalence of diabetes increased within four BMI groups (<25, 25-29, 30-34, and greater than or equal to35 kg/m(2)).
   RESULTS - In the U.S. population aged 20-74 years between 1976-1980 and 1999-2000,, significant increases in the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes (3.3-5.8%, probability >99.9%) were accompanied by nonsignificant increases in undiagnosed diabetes (2.0-2.4%, 66.6%). This resulted in an increase in total diabetes (5.3 8.2%, >99.9%) and a modest nonsignificant increase in the proportion of cases that were diagnosed (62-70%, 62.4%). However, these trends varied considerably by BMI level. In individuals with BMI greater than or equal to35 kg/m(2), diagnosed diabetes increased markedly (from 4.9% in 1960, to 8.6% during 1976-1980, to 15.1% in 1999-2000; probability >99.9%), whereas undiagnosed diabetes declined considerably (12.5% during 1976-1980 to 3.2% in 1999-2000, probability of increase 4.5%) Therefore, the proportion of total diabetes cases that were diagnosed increased from 41 to 83% (probability 99.9%) among individuals with BMI greater than or equal to35 kg/m(2). By comparison, changes in prevalence within BMI strata <35 kg/m(2) were modest and there was no increase in the percent of total cases that were diagnosed.
   CONCLUSIONS - National surveys over the last several decades have found large increases in diagnosed diabetes, particularly in overweight and obese individuals, but this has been accompanied by large decreases in undiagnosed diabetes only among individuals with BMI greater than or equal to35 kg/m(2). This suggests that improvements in diabetes awareness and detection are most prominent among this subgroup.

AB To develop an anti-obesity agent containing dietary components, we focused on the mechanisms that enhance both lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Caffeine and arginine (CA), a nonselective adenosine-receptor antagonist and an inducer of lipolytic hormone, respectively, were used to stimulate lipolysis. Soy isoflavones and L-camiline (SL), stimulators of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A and a cofactor for P-oxidation of fatty acids, respectively, were used to enhance fatty acid oxidation. Effects of a combination of CA and SL (CASL) on lipid metabolism were studied in vitro and in vivo. During 3T3-L1 differentiation, lipid accumulation was significantly lower in cells treated with CASL (50 mu mol/L, 1 mmol/L, 1 mu mol/L, and 1 mmol/L, respectively) compared with each alone. Lipolysis was also significantly greater in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with CASL (50 mu mol/L, I mmol/L, 10 mu mol/L and 0.5 mmol/L, respectively) compared with each alone. In addition, treatment with higher concentrations of CASL (2 mmol/L, 1 mmol/L, 10 mu mol/L, and 1 mmol/L, respectively) significantly enhanced beta-oxiclation in HepG2 cells. The effects of CASL-containing diets (250 mg, 6 g, 200 mg, and 1.5 g/kg diet, respectively) were studied in vivo. When KK mice were food deprived for 48 In and subsequently refed a fat-free diet for 72 h, hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation was significantly lower in mice fed CASL compared with the control mice. In addition, after obese KK mice were fed a low-fat diet for 2 wk, adipose tissue weights were significantly lower in those fed CASL, but not CA or SL alone, compared with the control mice. Plasma and liver TG levels were also lower in mice fed CASL than in the control mice. These results suggest that CASL is effective for controlling obesity.

AB Current pharmacological regimens for hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) are limited to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha activating fibrates, niacin, and statins. This pilot study examined the impact of simultaneous stimulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate with a beta-adrenergic agonist and PPAR gamma with pioglitazone (PIO) on lipoprotein composition in moderately obese, healthy subjects. Subjects were treated with PIO (45 mg) to stimulate PPAR or a combination of ephedrine (25 mg TID), a beta-agonist, with caffeine (200 mg TID), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (ephedrine plus caffeine), or both for 16 weeks. Lipoproteins were separated by gradient ultracentrifugation into very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and 3 HDL (L, M, and D) subfractions. Apolipoproteins were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. PIO alone reduced the core triglyceride (TG) content relative to cholesterol ester (CE) in VLDL (-40%), IDL (-25%), and HDL-M (-38%). Ephedrine plus caffeine alone reduced LDL CE (-13%), phospholipids (-9%), and apolipoprotein (apo) B (-13%); increased HDL-M LpA-I (HDL containing apoA-I without apoA-II, 28%), CE/TG (23%), and CE/apoA-I (8%) while reducing apoA-II (-10%); and increased HDL-L LpA-I (29%). Combination therapy reduced total plasma TG (-28%), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C, -10%), apoB (-16%), apoB/apoA-I ratio (-21%) while increasing HDL cholesterol (HDL-C, 21%), total plasma apoA-I (12%), LpA-1 (43%), and apoC-I (26%). It also reduced VLDL total mass (-34%) and apoC-III (-39%), LDL CE (-13%), apoB (-13%), and total mass (-11%). Combination therapy increased HDL-L CE/TG (32%), apoC-I (30%), apoA-I (56%), and LpA-I (70%), as well as HDL-M CE (35%), phospholipids (24%), total mass (19%), apoC-I (25%), apoA-I (18%), and LpA-I (56%). In conclusion, simultaneous beta-adrenergic and PPAR gamma activation produced beneficial effects on VLDL, LDL, HDL-L, and HDL-M. Perhaps the most important impact of combination therapy was dramatic increases in LpA-I and apoC-I in HDL-L and HDL-M, which were much greater than the sum of the monotherapies. Because LpA-1 appears to be the most efficient mediator of reverse-cholesterol transport and a major negative risk factor for cardiovascular disease, this combination therapy may provide very effective treatment of atherosclerosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that cocoa extract possesses hypoglycaemic and hypocholesterolaemic properties in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. However, there has been limited research on the effects of cocoa extract on obese-diabetic (Ob-db) rats that mimic human diabetes syndrome. Hence this study was initiated to determine the effect of cocoa extract containing polyphenols and methylxanthines on several biochemical parameters, namely glucose level, insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles of Ob-db rats.
   RESULTS: Intake of cocoa extract supplemented with polyphenols (2.17 mg epicatechin, 1.52 mg catechin, 0.25 mg dimer and 0.13 mg trimer g(-1) cocoa extract) and methylxanthines (3.55 mg caffeine and 2.22 mg theobromine g(-1) cocoa extract) for 4 weeks significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of obese-diabetic rats (Ob-db + cocoa) compared with non-supplemented animals (Ob-db). Short-term (acute) supplementation of cocoa extract significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the plasma glucose level at 60 and 90 min compared with untreated rats as assessed by the oral glucose tolerance test. However, no significant differences were observed in plasma glucose level, insulin level and insulin sensitivity after chronic (4 weeks) cocoa extract supplementation.
   CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that cocoa extract possesses hypocholesterolaemic properties and can exert a transient glucose-lowering effect but not long-term glucose control. (C) 2008 Society of Chemical Industry

AB There is an absence of research examining associations between food and beverage intake patterns and most research has centered on soft drinks, whereas research on overall beverage patterns is absent. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 99-02 for adults aged 19 y and older, we independently examined beverage and food intake patterns, as well as their interrelations. Cluster analysis generated mutually exclusive intake patterns for beverages and foods. Multinomial logistic regression models provided the odds of a given beverage pattern for each food pattern; we then compared the probability of a given beverage pattern for each food pattern. Six beverage and 6 food patterns emerged. Beverage patterns revealed that calorically sweetened, noncaloric, and diet beverages tended to be consumed independently of one another. Being in the Snacks and High-Fat Foods cluster increased the odds of being in the Coffee and Soda (odds ratio (OR): 1.62 [95% CI: 1.27-2.06]) or Nutrients and Soda (OR: 1.51 [95% CI: 1.14-2.00]) beverage clusters and decreased the odds of being in the Water and Tea (OR: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.52-0.97]) cluster relative to the odds of being in the Water, Coffee, and Tea cluster. The opposite was true for the Vegetable pattern. Furthermore, persons who had a healthier food pattern had a higher probability of having a noncaloric beverage pattern than persons who did not. Increasing awareness of both the contribution of calorie-containing beverages to overall energy intake and dietary patterns associated with these beverages helps inform policies targeted at reducing energy intake in the population.

AB Objective: Serious adverse health events have been reported with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedra and guarana. We sought to determine whether repeated dosing and multi-ingredient formulations contribute to the adverse effects of these supplements.
   Methods. In this study, 16 healthy adults (8 women) took 2 doses each of ephedra-guarana alone, Xenadrine RFA, a multicomponent dietary supplement containing 25 mg ephedra alkaloids and 200 mg caffeine, or placebo 5 hours apart in a randomized, double-blind, 3-arm crossover study.
   Results. Peak plasma ephedrine levels averaged 130 to 140 ng/mL. Compared with placebo, Xenadrine and ephedra-guarana significantly increased heart rate (maximum increase, 9.4 +/- 8.6 beats/min; P = .002), blood pressure (maximum increase in systolic and diastolic pressure, 11.5 +/- 10.7 min Hg and 7.3 +/- 7.4 min Hg, respectively; P = .015), postprandial glucose concentration (maximum change, 41.0 +/- 18.8 mg/dL; P < .0001), and insulin concentration (maximum change, 41.2 +/- 47.8 mu IU/mL; P = .005). Serum potassium concentrations were significantly decreased by both treatments. Hemodynamic and metabolic changes were observed after both the first and second doses. However, plasma free fatty acid concentrations increased after the first dose only. Xenadrine RFA produced higher increases in glucose concentration than ephedra-guarana, but no other pharmacodynamic differences between the treatments were found.
   Conclusions: Consumption of 2 doses of ephedra and guarana supplements, per supplement label recommendations, results in persistent increases in heart rate and blood pressure and unfavorable actions on glucose and potassium homeostasis. Such effects could be detrimental in persons with hypertension, atherosclerosis, or glucose intolerance, conditions that are strongly associated with obesity.

AB To help meet the needs of consumers, producers of dietary tea supplements, and researchers for information on health-promoting tea compounds, we compared the following conditions for the extraction of tea leaves and green tea-containing dietary supplements: 80% ethanol/water at 60 degrees C for 15 min and boiled water for 5 min. The following 7 catechins, 4 theaflavins, and 3 alkaloids were seperated in a 70-min single HPLC analysis(-)-epigallocatechin, (-)catechin, (+)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, (-)gallocatechin-3-gallate, (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate, (-)-catechin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate, theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. The following ranges of concentrations of flavonoids (catechins plus theaflavins) in the tea leaves extracted with 80% ethanol were observed (in mg/g): in 32 black teas, 19.8 to 115.1; in 24 green teas, 12.3 to 136.3; in 14 speciality teas, 4.9 to 118.5; in 7 herbal teas, 0 to 46.0. Total alkaloids in all teas ranged from 0 to 32.6 mg/g. Significantly greater amounts of flavonoids were extracted from the tea leaves with aqueous ethanol than with boiled water. Levels of tea catechins in 10 capsules sold as dietary supplements were about 50 to 75% lower than the amounts listed on the labels. Catechin content of 4 commercial green tea extracts ranged from 96 to 696 mg/g. The results make it possible to maximize the extraction of tea compounds to better relate the flavonoid and alkaloid content of teas and dietary tea supplements to their health-promoting effects.

AB Objective To determine whether children's sweetened-beverage consumption has changed over a 21-year period (1973 to 1994) in Bogalusa, LA, and whether trends in energy intake, milk consumption, and body mass index (BMI) varied among the sweetened-beverage consumption groups.
   Design Information on food and nutrient intake was derived from a single 24-hour dietary recall collected from children who participated in one of seven cross-sectional surveys.
   Subjects/Setting A total of 1,548 10-year-old children (65% white, 35% African American; 51% female, 49% male) were randomly selected to participate in the study.
   Statistical Analyses The Cochran-Armitage Trend test was applied to examine the trends in sweetened-beverage consumption by 10-year-old children over a 21-year period. A general linear model was used to examine the trend in milk consumption, energy intake, and BMI among the sweetened-beverage consumption groups.
   Results The percentage of children consuming sweetened beverages significantly decreased from 83% (1973) to 81% (1994) (P<.05), particularly consumption of soft drinks (P<.01) and coffee with sugar (P<.0001). However, the mean gram amount of tea with sugar consumed significantly increased (P<.0001), with no changes in the mean gram amount of fruit drinks, soft drinks, and coffee with sugar consumed. When comparing tertiles of sweetened-beverage consumption over time, the mean gram consumption significantly increased from 1973 to 1994 for those children who were in the medium (P<.001) to high (P<.0001) tertiles. The mean BMI significantly increased (P<.001) from 1973 to 1994 in children within all of the sweetened-beverage consumption groups; however, there were no significant differences in total BMI across the sweetened-beverage consumption groups. The total gram amount of milk consumption was significantly lower in the medium to high sweetened-beverage consumption groups compared with the lower to no sweetened-beverage consumption groups. Total energy intake remained unchanged from 1973 to 1994 within all four sweetened-beverage consumption groups. Total energy intake was significantly higher in the high sweetened-beverage consumption group compared with the other three sweetened-beverage consumption groups.
   Conclusions Children's sweetened-beverage consumption has changed over a 21-year period. The percentage of children consuming sweetened beverages decreased from 1973 to 1994, particularly consumption of soft drinks and coffee with sugar. Data suggest that there was no linear relationship between sweetened-beverage consumption and BMI and total energy intake. However, total milk consumption was lower in the medium to high sweetened-beverage consumption groups compared with the low to no consumption groups. More studies are needed to confirm these regional findings, which may not be reflective of national trends.

AB Few studies have investigated the prospective associations between diet or drinking patterns and abdominal obesity; we therefore investigated whether food and beverage groups or patterns predicted 6-year changes in waist circumference (WC) and whether these associations were independent of concurrent changes in BMI as a measure of general obesity. The subjects were 2300 middle-aged men and women with repeated measurements of dietary intake, BMI and WC from 1982 to 1993. Intakes from ten food groups and from coffee, tea, wine, beer and spirits were assessed; gender-specific food factors were identified by factor analyses. Multiple linear regression analyses were done before and after adjustment for concurrent changes in BMI. A high intake of potatoes seemed to prevent gain in WC for men, while a high intake of refined bread was associated with gain in WC for women. The association persisted for refined bread, but not for potatoes, after adjustment for concurrent BMI changes. Among women, but not men, high intakes of beer and spirits were associated with gain in WC in both models. A high intake of coffee for women and moderate to high intake of tea for men were associated with gain in WC, but the associations were weakened, especially for women, after adjustment for BMI changes. None of the food factors was associated with WC changes. Based on the present study, we conclude that very few food items and no food patterns seem to predict changes in WC, whereas high intakes of beer and spirits among women, and moderate to high tea intake among men, may promote gain in WC.

AB Objective: Our objective was to assess whether the association of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) with type 2 diabetes risk is modified by sex.
   Design and Subjects: We prospectively followed 12,861 Finnish men and women who were 35-74 yr of age, and free of diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer at baseline. Hazard ratios of type 2 diabetes were estimated for different levels of serum CRP.
   Results: During the follow-up, 208 men and 113 women developed diabetes. The multivariable-adjusted (age, physical activity, education, smoking, alcohol and coffee drinking, family history of diabetes, use of antihypertensive drugs, cholesterol-lowering agents, and hormone replacement therapy in women, systolic blood pressure, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum triglycerides, and body mass index) hazard ratios of diabetes at three different levels of CRP (0.05-0.99, 1.0-2.99, and >= 3.0 mg/liter) based on the recommendation by Centers for Disease Control and the American Heart Association were 1.00, 1.46, and 1.85 (P for trend = 0.006) in men, and 1.00, 3.83, and 8.37 (P for trend <0.001) in women, respectively. CRP had a stronger association with diabetes risk in women than men (P for interaction: chi(2) = 6.42; 1 df; P < 0.025). This positive association between CRP and diabetes risk did not change when participants were stratified by age group, smoking status, level of obesity, alcohol drinking habit, or family history of diabetes.
   Conclusions: High baseline level of serum CRP was associated with an increased risk of diabetes among both men and women, but this association was stronger in women than men. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 94: 2099-2105, 2009)

AB Background: Many differences exist between the two genders, i.e., biological, sociological, and also behavioral, which often depend on age. Objectives: The aim of this study was to find characteristic differences between nutritional habits of elderly men and women. Methods: 266 elderly people (109 men >65 years, and 157 women >60 years) were consecutively selected from primary care patients, in Budapest, Hungary. A self-managed questionnaire was filled in on lifestyle and eating habits, including a food frequency questionnaire. Medical checkup, registration of anthropometrical parameters, and laboratory tests were also performed. 53 subjects were also involved in a 3-day dietary recall. Results: The meal frequency was increased during aging in both genders, especially in men. Lunch was preferred by most of the women as a principal meal, but one quarter of the men had a filling dinner instead of lunch. Alcoholic beverages were consumed more and frequently by men. The fluid intake was low, especially in women. Milk and diary products, fresh fruit, bread, biscuits, chocolate, coffee and vitamin supplements were consumed more frequently by women. Almost all types of meat, eggs, and vegetables were more preferred by men and their energy intake was also higher (9.75 vs. 8.78 MJ). In both genders, fat represented a higher ratio (39%) of energy intake than recommended. The increase of body weight from youth to elderly was greater in women (14.04 vs. 10.65 kg). Prices had a higher impact on food purchases by women. Conclusion: High energy intake over decades led to overweight in both genders (BMI > 27 kg/m(2)). It seemed that the eating habits and food choices of women were closer to healthy ones and recent recommendations, although due to metabolic reasons and to the lower energy expenditure, they gained more weight. The elderly are the target population on every level of medical care. Further evaluations are needed to determine the differences in nutrition and to promote better administration of drugs and to establish public health suggestions. Copyright (C) 2006 S.

AB Lower socioeconomic status (SES) neighbourhoods may have differential access to food retailers, potentially explaining the varying area-level obesity rates. The food retail environment around 188 schools across Canada was examined, including full-service restaurants, fast food restaurants, sub/sandwich retailers, donut/coffee shops, convenience stores, and grocery stores. School addresses were linked to census data to obtain area-level SES measures. Access to food retailers was generally not associated with the neighbourhood SES in the immediate proximity. Within the broader neighbourhood, lower SES neighbourhoods had access to fewer food retailers of all types. This effect was diminished after taking population density into account.

AB Objective: To compare the average out-of-home (OH) consumption of foods and beverages, as well as energy intake, among populations from 10 European countries and to describe the characteristics of substantial OH caters, as defined for the purpose of the present study, in comparison to other individuals.
   Design: Cross-sectional study. Dietary data were collected through single 24-hour dietary recalls, in which the place of consumption was recorded. For the present study, substantial OH eaters were defined as those who consumed more than 25% of total daily energy intake at locations other than the household premises. Mean dietary intakes and the proportion of substantial OH eaters are presented by food group and country. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds of being a substantial OH eater in comparison to not being one, using mutually adjusted possible non-dietary determinants.
   Setting: Ten European countries participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).
   Subjects: The subjects were 34 270 individuals, 12 537 men and 21733 women, aged 35-74 years.
   Results: The fraction of energy intake during OH eating was generally higher in northern European countries than in the southern ones. Among the food and beverage groups, those selectively consumed outside the home were coffee/tea/waters and sweets and, to a lesser extent, cereals, meats, added lipids and vegetables. Substantial OH eating was positively associated with energy intake and inversely associated with age and physical activity. Substantial OH eating was less common among the less educated compared with the more educated, and more common during weekdays in central and north Europe and during the weekend in south Europe.
   Conclusions: Eating outside the home was associated with sedentary lifestyle and increased energy intake; it was more common among the young and concerned in particular coffee/tea/waters and sweets.

AB Although it is known that tea catechins exert potent effects in obese subjects, there is scant information concerning these effects on body weight gain and body fat accumulation in the non-obese. We studied normal rats fed a normal diet and water containing either 0.1% or 0.5% tea catechins to examine the effects on body fat content and serum cholesterol levels, as well as evaluating whether the effect is related to bile acids, which in recent years have emerged as an inducer of energy expenditure. The administration of 0.5% catechins decreased the accumulation of body fat and the serum levels of cholesterol and bile acids. These results indicate that tea catechins modulate lipid metabolism not only in obese subjects, but also in the non-obese.

AB A recently developed oral formulation in the form of coated tablets (Monoselect Camellia (R)) (MonCam) containing highly bioavailable green tea extract (GreenSelect (R) Phytosome) was tested in obese subjects (n=100) of both genders on a hypocaloric diet. Fifty subjects were assigned to the green tea extract plus hypocaloric diet, while the other 50 subjects followed the hypocaloric diet only. After 90 days of treatment, significant weight loss and decreased body mass index (BMI) were observed in the group taking the herbal extract (14-kg loss in the green tea group compared to a 5-kg loss in the diet-only group); waistline was reduced only in male subjects. Besides the effect on weight and BMI, biochemical parameters (LDL-, HDL-, and total cholesterol, triglycerides, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin, and cortisol) were improved in both groups, Leptin, not tested in the diet-only group, was reduced in patients taking MonCam. Taking into consideration the high safety profile of the product and the total absence of adverse effects observed during and after the trial, MonCam appears to be a safe and effective tool for weight loss.

AB A naturally decaffeinated tea, Camellia sinensis var. ptilophylla (cocoa tea), has long been popular in southern China as a healthy beverage. Our experiments indicate that a single oral administration of 500 mg/kg of cocoa tea extract suppresses increases in plasma triacylgycerol (TG) levels when fed with 5 mL/kg of olive or lard oil in mice and that the inhibition rates are 22.9% and 31.5%, respectively, compared with controls. Under the same condition, cocoa tea extract did not affect the level of plasma free fatty acid. Likewise, the extract reduced the lymphatic absorption of lipids at 250 and 500 mg/kg. Also, cocoa tea extract and polyphenols isolated from cocoa tea inhibit pancreatic lipase. These findings suggest that cocoa tea has hypolipemic activity, which may be due to the suppression of digestive lipase activity by the polyphenols contained within the tea.

AB Extracts of non-fermented teas precipitated cholesterol and decreased dialysability of lipids in an in vitro model that simulated digestion in humans. The efficiency of tea extracts was affected by catechins and mainly by EGCG, ECG, GCG and CG. Total amounts and concentrations of individual catechins in extracts depended strongly on the tea brands. There were significant relationships between amounts of dialysable products of triglyceride hydrolysis, amounts of precipitated cholesterol, and concentrations of individual catechin gallates in tea brews. Dialysability of lipids was effectively reduced by tea extracts high in GCG and CG. Dialysability of lipids was strongly correlated with the sum of GCG and CG (R-2=84.64%) whereas precipitation of cholesterol was highly correlated with total amounts of catechin gallates in the tea extracts (R-2=89.59%).

AB In a previous study, evidence was presented that oolong tea (OT) reduced abdominal fat accumulation in diet-induced obese mice. In the study presented here, we examined the sympathetic and cardiovascular effects of intraduodenal injection of OT in urethane-anesthetized rats and found that it suppressed renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and blood pressure (BP). In addition, pretreatment with the histaminergic H3-receptor antagonist thioperamide or bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy eliminated the effects of OT on RSNA and BP. Furthermore, OT drinking for 14 weeks reduced BP elevation in spontaneously hypertensive rats. These results thus suggest that OT may exert its hypotensive action through changes in autonomic neurotransmission via an afferent neural mechanism. Moreover, we found that intraduodenal injection of decaffeinated OT lowered RSNA and BP as well as OT, indicating that substances other than caffeine contained in OT may function as effective modulators of RSNA and BP.

AB The aim of present study was to investigate the anti-obesity effect of Ilex paraguariensis extract and its molecular mechanism in rats rendered obese by a high-fat diet (HFD). T paraguariensis extract supplementation significantly lowered body weight, visceral fat-pad weights, blood and hepatic lipid, glucose, insulin, and leptin levels of rats administered HFD. Feeding I. paraguariensis extract reversed the HFD-induced downregulation of the epididymal adipose tissue genes implicated in adipogenesis or thermogenesis, such as peroxisome proliferators' activated receptor gamma 2, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein, sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, uncoupling protein 2, and uncoupling protein 3. Dietary supplementation with I. paraguariensis extract protected rats from the HFD-induced decreases in the phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/AMPK and phospho-acetylCoA carboxylase (ACC)/ACC protein ratio related to fatty acid oxidation in the edipidymal adipose tissue. The present study reports that the I. paraguariensis extract can have a protective effect against a HFD-induced obesity in rats through an enhanced expression of uncoupling proteins and elevated AMPK phosphorylation in the visceral adipose tissue.

AB A 45-year-old woman, with a body mass index of 41.8 kg/m(2) and a medical history of anxiety-depression syndrome, had iatrogenic hypothyroidism and degenerative osteoarticular pathology of the spinal column and complained of a burning sensation behind the sternum associated with ail acidic taste in her mouth. Symptoms had appeared 3 months previously and were especially prevalent when lying down, following large meals or after drinking coffee. The patient had started to experience symptoms on most days approximately 1 month earlier. Upper digestive endoscopy (UDE) revealed isolated erosions of the distal third of the oesophagus, compatible with a diagnosis of erosive reflux oesophagitis. Lifestyle changes were recommended and 8 weeks' treatment with pantoprazole 40 mg/day taken 15-30 Minutes before breakfast was prescribed. Follow-up UDE showed resolution of oesophageal lesions with no pathological changes of the mucosa. Mild regurgitation and pyrosis persisted; therefore the patient continued to receive pantoprazole 40 mg for a further 3 weeks.

AB Purpose of review
   Oxidative stress seems to play a pathogenic role in the vicious circle linking obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Hypothetically, dietary antioxidants should decrease oxidative stress and therefore improve glucose metabolism. However, many interventional trials evaluating the effect of antioxidant supplementation on insulin resistance, plasma glucose levels and risk of type 2 diabetes gave inconsistent results.
   Recent findings
   Many studies have recently demonstrated a positive effect of vitamin supplementation and of food enriched in antioxidants (seafood, whole nut, etc.) on markers of oxidative stress, insulin resistance, fasting plasma glucose and incidence of diabetes. The present paper critically reviews the consolidated notions on dietary antioxidants in view of the recent evidence.
   Summary
   Although a definitive estimation of the impact of dietary antioxidants on glucose metabolism is still lacking, food with high antioxidant concentrations seems to have a protective effect, improving oxidative stress-mediated detrimental effects on the vicious circle linking obesity, insulin resistance and redox imbalance.

AB The scale of the obesity epidemic creates a pressing consumer need as well as an enormous business opportunity for successful development and marketing of food products with added benefits for weight control. A number of proposed functional food ingredients have been shown to act post-absorptively to influence substrate utilization or thermogenesis. Characteristics and supporting data on conjugated linoleic acid, diglycerides, medium-chain triglycerides, green tea, ephedrine, caffeine, capsaicin and calcium, are reviewed here, giving examples of how these could act to alter energy expenditure or appetite control. Consideration is also given to other factors, in addition to efficacy, which must be satisfied to get such ingredients into foods. We conclude that, for each of the safe, putatively metabolically active agents, there remain gaps in clinical evidence or knowledge of mechanisms, which need to be addressed in order to specify the dietary conditions and food product compositions where these ingredients could be of most benefit for weight control.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a catechin-rich beverage on body fat and cardiovascular disease risk factors in obese children and to verify the safety of its use.
   Methods and Procedures: Obese or near-obese Japanese children were recruited for this study. A double-blind, randomized, controlled study was performed with a 4-week lead-in, a 24-week beverage ingestion period and a 12-week follow-up. Subjects ingested green tea containing 576 mg catechins ( catechin group) or 75 mg catechins ( control group) once per day for 24 weeks. Randomization was stratified by gender, age, and BMI. Subjects were instructed to maintain their usual lifestyles during the study period.
   Results: Data were analyzed using samples from 40 subjects ( catechin group; n = 21, control group; n = 19). There were no significant differences in major outcome variables, such as body fat mass, between the catechin and the control groups. When, however, the analysis was stratified using the median of the week-0 values, the decrease at week 24 in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the catechin group was significantly greater than that in the control group for the above-median category. Ingestion of the catechin-rich beverage was not associated with any adverse effects.
   Discussion: These findings suggest that ingestion of a catechin-rich beverage ameliorates serious obesity and cardiovascular disease risk factors without raising any safety concerns in Japanese children.

TI Stimulation of sympathetic innervation in the upper gastrointestinal
   tract as a treatment for obesity
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
LA English
DT Article
AB Sympathetic activity and obesity have a reciprocal relationship. Firstly, hypothalamic obesity is associated with decreased sympathetic activity. Caffeine and ephedrine increase sympathetic activity and induce weight loss, of which 25% is due to increased metabolic rate and 75% is due to a reciprocally decreased food intake. Secondly, hormones and drugs that affect body weight have an inverse relationship between food intake and metabolic rate. Neuropepticle Y decreases sympathetic activity and increases food intake and body weight. Thirdly, a gastric pacemaker Transcend (R) and vagotorny increase the ratio of sympathetic to parasympathetic activation, decrease food intake, and block gut satiety hormones. Weight loss with the pacemaker or vagotomy is variable. Significant weight reduction is seen only in a small group of those treated. This suggests that activation of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system may be most important for weight loss. Systemic sympathetic activation causes weight loss in obese patients, but side effects limited its use. We hypothesize that selective local electrical sympathetic stimulation of the upper gastrointestinal tract may induce weight loss and offer a safer, yet effective, obesity treatment. Celiac ganglia delivers sympathetic innervation to the upper gastrointestinal tract. Voltage regulated electrical simulation of the rat celiac ganglia increased metabolic rate in a dose-dependent manner. Stimulation of 6, 3, or 1.5 V increased metabolic rate 15.6%, 6.2%, and 5%, respectively in a single rat. These responses support our hypothesis that selective sympathetic stimulation of the upper GI tract may treat obesity while avoiding side effects of systemic sympathetic activation.

AB We have found natural products exhibiting lipolysis-promoting activity in subcutaneous adipocytes, which are less sensitive to hormones than visceral adipocytes. The activities and a action mechanisms of a novel plant extract of Cirsium oligophyllum (CE) were investigated in isolated adipocytes from rat subcutaneous fat, and its fat-reducing effects by peroral administration and topical application were evaluated in vivo. CE-induced lipolysis was synergistically enhanced by caffeine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and was reduced by propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist. The peroral administration of 10% CE solution to Wistar rats for 32 days reduced body weight gain, subcutaneous, and visceral fat weights by 6.6, 26.2, and 3.0%, respectively, as compared to the control group. By the topical application of 2% of this extract to rats for 7 days, weight of subcutaneous fat in the treated skin was reduced by 23.2%. This fat mass reduction was accompanied by the up-regulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP), a principal thermogenic mitochondrial molecule related to energy dissipating, in subcutaneous fat and UCP3 in skin except for the fat layer. These results indicate that CE promotes lipolysis via a mechanism involving the beta adrenergic receptor, and affects the body fat mass. This fat reduction may be partially due to UCP up-regulation in the skin including subcutaneous fat. This is the first report showing that repeated lipolysis promotion through CE administration may be beneficial for the systematic suppression of body fat accumulation or the control of fat distribution in obesity.

AB Objective: Obese patients respond differently to weight loss interventions. No efficient diagnostic tool exists to separate obese patients into subtypes as a means to improve prediction of response to interventions. We aimed to separate obese subjects into distinct subgroups using microarray technology to identify gene expression-based subgroups to predict weight loss.
   Design: A total of 72 obese men and women without family history of diabetes were enrolled in the study; 52 were treated with ephedra and caffeine (E+C) and 20 with placebo for 8 weeks. Adipose and skeletal muscle tissue biopsies were performed at baseline. RNA sample pairs were labeled and hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays. Quantile normalization and gene shaving were performed, and a clustering algorithm was then applied to cluster subjects based on their gene expression profile. Clusters were visualized using heat maps and related to weight changes.
   Results: Cluster analysis of gene expression data revealed two distinct subgroups of obesity and predicted weight loss in response to the treatment with E+C. One cluster ('red') decreased to 96.87 +/- 2.35% body weight, and the second cluster ('green') decreased to 95.59 +/- 2.75% body weight (P<0.05). 'Red' cluster had less visceral adipose tissue mass ( 2.77 +/- 1.08 vs 3.43 +/- 1.49 kg; P<0.05) and decreased size of the very large fat cells (1.45 +/- 0.61 vs 2.16 +/- 1.74 mu l; P<0.05) compared to 'green' cluster. Gene expression for both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was also different between clusters.
   Conclusions: Our study provides the first evidence that the combined approach of gene expression profiling and cluster analysis can identify discrete subtypes of obesity, these subtypes have different physiological characteristics and respond differently to an adrenergic weight loss therapy. This brings us that into an era of personalized treatment in the obesity

AB Over the past years, there has been an explosive increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and this is expected to continue, entailing associated morbidity and mortality. An increasing number of studies explore the different ways T2DM could be prevented. On-going lifestyle modifications need to be addressed. High-risk patients should be given counselling on weight loss, possibly using a low glycaemic index diet, with a target of around 7-10% over 6-12 months, as well as instruction for increasing physical activity to around 150 min of physical exercise weekly (NNT = 4-8). Moderate alcohol consumption and coffee consumption may also be of benefit (NNT = 89 and 66, respectively). Metformin (NNT = 14), acarbose (NNT = 11) and troglitazone (NNT = 6) have been shown to prevent/delay T2DM and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins appear to have an adjunctive role (NNT = 42 and 112, respectively). Trials with orlistat and bariatric surgery have also prevented T2DM (NNT = 36 and 6, respectively), and forthcoming treatment with GLP1 mimetics appears promising. Diabetes prevention studies should help create well-defined strategies for screening and treating high-risk populations in the real world, as prevention is our only chance to alleviate the ever growing burden of diabetes mellitus in the world.

AB (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major flavonoid in green tea has multiple health benefits including chemoprevention, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects. In connection with these effects, EGCG can be a candidate to help the treatment of metabolic diseases. Metformin is a widely used anti-diabetic drug regulating cellular energy homeostasis via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Therefore, the combination of metformin with EGCG may have additive or synergistic effects on treatment of type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, there is no report for the pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interaction of EGCG with metformin. Here, we evaluated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between metformin and EGCG in rats. Pharmacokinetics parameters of metformin were measured after oral administration of metformin in rats pre-treated with EGCG (10 mg/kg) or saline for 7 days. The results showed that there is no significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between saline control and EGCG-treated group. In addition, the hepatic AMPK activation by metformin in EGCG-treated rats was also similar to the control. The lack of additive effects of EGCG on AMPK activation or intrarcellular uptake of metformin was also evaluated in cells in the presence or absence of EGCG. Treatment of HepG2 cells with EGCG inhibited the metformin-induced AMPK activation. Combined results suggested that EGCG has no effect on the pharmarcokinetics of metformin but may contribute to metformin action.

AB To investigate the association between green tea consumption and the risk of endometrial cancer restricted to endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEA) using a case-control design in Japan.
   The cases were 152 patients with histopathologically diagnosed EEA, and the controls were 285 healthy women who were matched for age and area of residence with individual cases. The subjects completed a questionnaire regarding health-related lifestyle and reproductive history, and a food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) of EEA for frequency of green tea consumption were calculated by conditional logistic regression analysis.
   We observed a significant inverse association between green tea consumption and the risk of EEA with a dose-response relationship. The multivariate-adjusted OR of EEA was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.37-1.58) for those in the second quartile of green tea consumption (5-6 cups/week-1 cup/day), 0.61 (0.30-1.23) in the third quartile (2-3 cups/day), and 0.33 (0.15-0.75) in the highest quartile (a parts per thousand yen4 cups/day), as referenced with those in the lowest quartile (a parts per thousand currency sign4 cups/week; p for trend = 0.007). This inverse association was consistently observed regardless of the presence or absence of factors such as obesity and menopause.
   Green tea consumption may be associated with a lower risk of EEA.

AB In this present study, we investigated the effects of cocoa extract containing polyphenols and methylxanthines prepared from cocoa powder on the biochemical parameters of obese-diabetic (Ob-db) rats. Obese-diabetic (Ob-db) rats were developed using a high-fat diet (49% fat, 32% carbohydrate, and 19% protein from total energy, kcal) for 3 months, followed by a low dose (35 mg/kg body weight) streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Cocoa extract (600 mg/kg body weight/day) was given to the rats for 4 weeks. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in fasting plasma glucose and insulin level after 4 weeks of cocoa extract administration. Oral glucose tolerance test revealed that cocoa supplementation in Ob-db rats significantly (p < 0.05) reduced plasma glucose at 60 and 90 min compared to unsupplemented Ob-db rats. Plasma free fatty acid and oxidative stress biomarker (8-isoprostane) were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after cocoa supplementation. Superoxide dismutase activity was enhanced in Ob-db compared to that in nonsupplemented rats. However, no change was observed in catalase activity. The results showed that cocoa supplementation had an effect on postprandial glucose control but not for long term (4 weeks). Moreover, cocoa supplementation could reduce circulating plasma free fatty acid and 8-isoprostane and may enhance the antioxidant defense system.

AB Green tea contains a high level of polyphenolic compounds known as catechins. We investigated the effects of green tea extract (GTE), which is rich in catechins, on endurance capacity, energy metabolism, and fat oxidation in BALB/c mice over a 10-wk period. Swimming times to exhaustion for mice fed 0.2-0.5% (wt/wt) GTE were prolonged by 8-24%. The effects were dose dependent and accompanied by lower respiratory quotients and higher rates of fat oxidation as determined by indirect calorimetry. In addition, feeding with GTE increased the level of beta-oxidation activity in skeletal muscle. Plasma lactate concentrations in mice fed GTE were significantly decreased after exercise, concomitant with increases in free fatty acid concentrations in plasma, suggesting an increased lipid use as an energy source in GTE-fed mice. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major component of tea catechins, also enhanced endurance capacity, suggesting that the endurance-improving effects of GTE were mediated, at least in part, by EGCG. The beta-oxidation activity and the level of fatty acid translocase/CD36 mRNA in the muscle was higher in GTE-fed mice compared with control mice. These results indicate that GTE are beneficial for improving endurance capacity and support the hypothesis that the stimulation of fatty acid use is a promising strategy for improving endurance capacity.

AB Objective The purpose of this study was to examine beverage consumption across age, sex, and race/ethnicity categories using the most current data available, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002.
   Design Beverage consumption that included fluid milk, fruit juices, regular and diet carbonated soft drinks, regular and diet fruit drinks/ades, coffee, and tea was examined among white, African-American, and Mexican-American persons in age groups 6 to 11 years, 12 to 19 years, 20 to 39 years, 40 to 59 years, and >60 years. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 were used in this study.
   Statistical analysis Group means were estimated for the age group, sex, and race/ethnicity subgroups. The probability that any of these group means were equal to one another was tested using statistical software.
   Results The data,showed marked differences in beverage consumption depending on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. In general, males consumed more beverages than did females. Specifically, white and Mexican-American persons of all ages consumed more milk than did African-American persons. On average, African-American males and females of all ages consumed significantly more fruit drinks/ades than did other race/ethnicity groups. In contrast, white persons consumed more carbonated soft drinks than did other race/ethnicity groups.
   Conclusion Average beverage consumption varied depending on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Knowledge of differences in beverage consumption patterns is important for food and nutrition professionals and nutrition policymakers. Better understanding of the many factors that influence beverage consumption levels is needed.

AB Epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between stressful events (nutritional, hormonal or environmental) in early life and development of adult diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular failure. It is known that gestation and lactation are crucial periods for healthy growth in mammals and that the sympathoadrenal system is markedly influenced by environmental conditions during these periods. We previously demonstrated that neonatal hyperleptinaemia in rats programmes higher body weight, higher food intake and hypothalamic leptin resistance in adulthood. Using this model of programming, we investigated adrenal medullary function and effects on cardiovascular parameters in male rats in adulthood. Leptin treatment during the first 10 days of lactation (8 mu g 100 g(-1) day(-1), S.C.) resulted in lower body weight (6.5%, P < 0.05), hyperleptinaemia (10-fold, P < 0.05) and higher catecholamine content in adrenal glands (18.5%, P < 0.05) on the last day of treatment. In adulthood (150 days), the rats presented higher body weight (5%, P < 0.05), adrenal catecholamine content (3-fold, P < 0.05), tyrosine hydroxylase expression (35%, P < 0.05) and basal and caffeine-stimulated catecholamine release (53% and 100%, respectively, P < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were also higher in adult rats (7% and 6%, respectively, P < 0.05). Our results show that hyperleptinaemia in early life increases adrenal medullary function in adulthood and that this may alter cardiovascular parameters. Thus, we suggest that imprinting factors which increase leptin and catecholamine levels during the neonatal period could be involved in development of adult chronic diseases.

TI Food Environments in University Dorms 20,000 Calories per Dorm Room and
   Counting
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID AVAILABILITY; OBESITY
AB Background: Few young adults meet national dietary recommendations. Although home food availability likely has important influences on dietary intake, little research has examined thiS issue among young adults. The objective of this research was to conduct a detailed, observational assessment of food and beverages available in college-student dormitory rooms.
   Methods: Dormitory-residing students (n=100) were recruited from a large, public university. Research staff completed a detailed inventory of food and beverages in the clorin rooms, including nutrient contents and purchasing Sources. Data were collected and analyzed in 2008.
   Results: The mean number of food and beverage items per participant was 47 (range: 0-208), with 4% of participants not having any food or beverages. More than 70% Of Students had each of the following types of items: salty snacks, cereal or granola bars, main dishes, desserts or candy, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Fewer students had low-calorie beverages, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, tea/coffee, and 100% fruit/vegetable juice. The average number of calories per dorm room was 22,888. Items purchased by parents had a higher calorie and fat content than items purchased by students.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that students maintain a wide array of food and beverages in their dormitory rooms. Parents purchased a Substantial amount of food for their children's dormitory rooms, and these food items were less healthful than the food that students purchased. The foods observed in college students' living spaces may have air important impact on eating habits. Overall, young adult-oriented obesity prevention efforts are needed, and improving the various facets of campus food environments may mark an important component of such strategies.

AB Background: Green tea consumption is reportedly associated with various health-promoting properties. For example, it has been shown to promote fat oxidation in humans at rest and to prevent obesity and improve insulin sensitivity in mice.
   Objective: We investigated the effects of acute ingestion of green tea extract (GTE) on glucose tolerance and fat oxidation during moderate-intensity exercise in humans.
   Design: Two studies were performed, both with a counter-balanced crossover design. In study A, 12 healthy men performed a 30-min cycling exercise at 60% of maximal oxygen consumption (<(V)over dot>O(2)max) before and after supplementation. In study B, 11 healthy men took an oral-glucose-tolerance test before and after supplementation. In the 24-h period before the experimental trials, participants ingested 3 capsules containing either GTE (total: 890 +/- 13 mg polyphenols and 366 +/- 5 mg EGCG) or a corn-flour placebo (total: 1729 +/- 22 mg).
   Results: Average fat oxidation rates were 17% higher after ingestion of GTE than after ingestion of placebo (0.41 +/- 0.03 and 0.35 +/- 0.03 g/min, respectively; P < 0.05). Moreover, the contribution of fat oxidation to total energy expenditure was also significantly higher, by a similar percentage, after GTE supplementation. The insulin area under the curve decreased in both the GTE and placebo trials (3612 +/- 301 and 4280 +/- 309 mu IU/dL (.) 120 min, respectively; P < 0.01), and there was a concomitant increase of 13% in insulin sensitivity.
   Conclusions: Acute GTE ingestion can increase fat oxidation during moderate-intensity exercise and can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in healthy young men.

AB Objectives: In the present study, we investigated whether replacement of tap water by fructose or sucrose solutions affect rat body weight and insulin action in skeletal muscles.
   Methods: Rats were fed standard rodent chow ad libitum with water, or water containing fructose (10.5% or 35%) or sucrose (10,5% or 35%) for 11 weeks. Body weight and energy intake from chow and drinking solutions were measured. Urinary catecholamines secretion was determined after 50-60 days. At the end of the feeding period, soleus and epitrochlearis were removed for in vitro measurements of glucose uptake (with tracer amount of 2- [H-3]-deoxy-D-glucose) and PKB Ser(473) phosphorylation (assessed by Western Blot) with or without insulin.
   Results: Fructose and sucrose solutions enhanced daily energy intake by about 15% without increasing rat body weight. Secretion of urinary noradrenaline was higher in rats drinking a 35% sucrose solution than in rats drinking water. In the other groups, urinary noradrenaline secretion was similar to rats consuming water. Urinary adrenaline secretion was similar in all groups. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation were not reduced by intake of fructose or sucrose solution.
   Conclusions: Fructose and sucrose solutions enhanced energy intake but did not increase body weight. Although noradrenaline may regulate body weight in rats drinking 35% sucrose solution, body weight seems to be regulated by other mechanisms. Intake of fructose or sucrose solution did not impair insulin-stimulated glucose uptake or signaling in skeletal muscles.

AB A large number of so-called diet foods containing Citrus aurantium (CA) and its active constituent, synephrine, for suppressing body fat accumulation are currently on the market. However, only one human study has demonstrated the efficacy of CA, and its potential cardiotoxicity has been reported in a rat study. Therefore, we investigated the safety of CA and its suppressive effect against body fat accumulation in rats. High-fat (20% (w/w)) diets containing CA (synephrine content, 6.4%) at 0, 40, 200, 1,000, and 5,000 mg/kg diet were fed to rats ad libitum for 79 days. For dieting, the recommended daily intake of CA in many dietary supplements ranges from 100 to 1,000 mg/day, and the amount used in this experiment was approximately equivalent to 40 and/or 200 mg/kg diet. In the 5,000 mg/kg CA group, the adrenaline and dopamine concentrations in plasma were significantly higher, perirenal fat pad weight was significantly lower, and body weight tended to be lower than in the control group. Although no abnormalities of serum clinical and biochemical parameters were observed except for adrenaline and dopamine, and also no histopathological abnormalities were evident in the heart, heart weight in the 5,000 mg/kg CA group was significantly lower than in the control group. Therefore, it is necessary to examine more precisely the potential cardiotoxicity caused by excess intake of CA. Particularly, the elucidation of influences of the simultaneous intake of CA and some stimulants, such as caffeine, awaits further characterization.

AB Many food components can influence satiety or energy intake. Combined together, these food components could represent an interesting dietary strategy in the prevention and treatment of obesity. The aims of this study were: 1) to determine the effect of a functional food in the form of a healthy meal course on subsequent energy intake and satiety; 2) to verify if it is possible to maintain palatability while preserving the satiating effects of the test meal. Thirteen subjects were invited to eat two lunch sessions: healthy and control meal courses (2090 kJ/meal). Anthropometric and ad libitum food intake measurements, and visual analogue scales (VAS) were performed during the two lunch sessions. The healthy main course acutely decreased energy intake during the rest of the meal (-744 kJ, P <= 0.0001) and lipid (-6%, P <= 0.0001) compared with the control meal. VAS ratings during the course of the testing showed a meal effect for hunger, desire to eat and prospective food consumption (P <= 0.05) and a time effect for all appetite sensations (P: <= 0.0001). VAS scores on hunger ratings were lower for the healthy meal (P <= 0.05), whereas fullness ratings were higher shortly after the healthy main course (P <= 0.05). The healthy meal produced a slightly higher palatability rating but this effect was not statistically significant. These results suggest that it is possible to design a healthy meal that decreases spontaneous energy intake and hunger without compromising palatability.

AB Objective: Food marketing is linked to childhood obesity through its influence on children's food preferences, purchase requests and food consumption. We aimed to describe the volume and nature of outdoor food advertisements and factors associated with outdoor food advertising in the area surrounding Australian primary schools.
   Methods: Forty primary schools in Sydney and Wollongong were selected using random sampling within population density and socio-economic strata. The area within a 500m radius of each school was scanned and advertisements coded according to pre-defined criteria, including: food or non-food product advertisement, distance from the school, size and location. Food advertisements were further categorised as core foods, non-core foods and miscellaneous drinks (tea and coffee).
   Results: The number of advertisements identified was 9,151, of which 2,286 (25%) were for food. The number of non-core food advertisements was 1,834, this accounted for 80% of food advertisements. Soft drinks and alcoholic beverages were the food products most commonly advertised around primary schools (24% and 22% of food advertisements, respectively). Non-core food products were twice as likely to be advertised close to a primary school (95 non-core food advertisements per km(2) within 250 m vs. 46 advertisements per km(2) within 250-500 m).
   Conclusions: The density of non-core food advertisements within 500 m of primary schools, and the potential for repeated exposure of children to soft drink and alcoholic beverage advertisements in particular, highlights the need for outdoor food marketing policy intervention.
   Implications: Outdoor advertising is an important food marketing tool that should be considered in future debates on regulation of food marketing to children.

AB Purpose: To identify modifiable lifestyle factors associated with blood pressure among U.S. adolescents.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 4508 12-19-year-old respondents of the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) were measured and adjusted for gender, age, and height using z-scores (SBPZ and DBPZ). Body mass index (BMI) was adjusted for gender and age (BMIZ). Questionnaires were used to measure nutrient intake (carbohydrate, protein, saturated and unsaturated fat, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber, and caffeine) and activities (physical activities and sedentary activities, including television watching).
   Results: In the adjusted model (R-2 = .115), SBPZ was higher by .022 standard deviation (SD) (95% confidence interval [CI]:.007-038, equivalent to similar to .2 mmHg) per 1-hour increments in sedentary activities; higher by .244 SD (.198 - .289, similar to 2.6 mmHg) per 1 SD of BMIZ; and lower by .099 SD (-.192 to -.006, similar to 1.1 mmHg) per 100 g of carbohydrate intake. Unexpectedly, BMIZ was negatively associated with DBPZ (-.078 per 1 SD, -.114 to -.043, similar to.9 mmHg).
   Conclusions: Among U.S. adolescents, sedentary activities and BMI are positively associated with SBP after adjustment for confounding factors and mediators, while BMI is negatively associated with DBP. If confirmed by further studies, population-based interventions aimed at sedentary activities may be practical approaches to decrease SBP and the risk of obesity among adolescents.) 2007 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

AB Objectives: To: 1) characterize diet in Inuvialuit; 2) determine the foods and nutrients to be targeted for a nutritional intervention program; and 3) develop a Quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (QFFQ) to evaluate the program and monitor nutrition transition for Inuvialuit in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada.
   Methods: Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls were collected among 101 Inuvialuit aged 19 years and over in two communities in the NWT. All foods reported in the recall were tabulated for inclusion in the QFFQ.
   Results: Forty-eight men and 53 women (mean age 49 and 45 yrs, respectively) completed the recalls. Mean energy intake was 2,352 kcal and 1,739 kcal for men and women, respectively. Mean daily intakes of many nutrients including dietary fibre, calcium, and vitamins A, C and E, and total folate were much lower than recommended. The most frequently reported foods were non-nutrient-dense store-bought foods. Most traditional foods (TF) were reported one time by one person. The top two contributors to energy intake, 'sugar added to tea and coffee' and 'sweetened juices and drinks', were targeted by the intervention program. A 145-item QFFQ was developed including 41 TF and 8 categories of consumption frequency.
   Conclusions: This study has provided dietary intake data previously unavailable for Inuvialuit and highlighted nutrients and foods to be targeted for the intervention program. The QFFQ is up-to-date, culturally appropriate, and currently being used to evaluate the intervention program, Healthy Foods North, which aims to reduce dietary- and lifestyle-related risk factors for chronic disease in Inuvialuit.

AB Coca-Cola was invented in May 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia by a pharmacist who, by accident or design, mixed carbonated water with the syrup of sugar, phosphoric acid, caffeine, and other natural flavors to create what is known as "the world's favorite soft drink." Coca-Cola is currently sold in more than 200 countries and in early 2000, the company sold its 10 billionth unit case of Coca-Cola branded products. Given the worldwide consumption of Coca-Cola, a project of experimental bioassays to study its long-term effects when administered as substitute for drinking water on male and female Sprague-Dawley rats was planned and executed. The objective of the project was to study whether and how long-term consumption of Coca-Cola affects the basic tumorigram of test animals. The bioassays were performed on rats beginning at different ages, namely: (a) on males and females exposed since embryonic life or from 7 weeks of age; and (b) on males and females exposed from 30, 39, or 55 weeks of age. Overall, the project included 1999 rats. During the biophase, data were collected on fluid and feed consumption, body weight, and survival. Animals were kept under observation until spontaneous death and underwent complete necropsy. The results indicate: (a) an increase in body weight in all treated animals; (b) a statistically significant increase of the incidence in females, both breeders and offspring, bearing malignant mammary tumors; (c) a statistically significant increase in the incidence of exocrine ademonas of the pancreas in both male and female breeders and offspring; and (d) an increased incidence, albeit not statistically significant, of pancreatic islet cell carcinomas in females, a malignant tumor which occurs very rarely in our historical controls. On the basis of the results of this study, excessive consumption of regular soft-drinks should be generally discouraged, in particular for children and adolescents.

AB Background: Epidemiologic studies have shown effects of lifestyle-related factors on risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, few cohort studies have incorporated, in a strict and in-depth manner, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections or investigated synergism between such factors.
   Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study using sera stored before hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis in the longitudinal cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The study included 224 hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 644 controls that were matched to the cases on gender, age, city, time of serum storage, and method of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose.
   Results: Univariate analysis showed that HBV and HCV infections, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes mellitus were associated with increased hepatocellular carcinoma risk, whereas coffee drinking was associated with decreased hepatocellular carcinoma risk. Multivariate relative risks of hepatocellular carcinoma (95% confidence interval) were 45.8 (15.2-138), 101 (38.7-263), 70.7 (8.3-601), 4.36 (1.48-13.0), and 4.57 (1.85-11.3), for HBV infection alone, HCV infection alone, both HBV and HCV infections, alcohol consumption of >= 40 g of ethanol per day, and BMI of >25.0 kg/m(2) 10 years before diagnosis, respectively. HBV and HCV infection and BMI of >25.0 kg/m(2) remained independent risk factors even after adjusting for severity of liver fibrosis. Among HCV-infected individuals, the relative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma for a 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was 1.39 (P = 0.003).
   Conclusions: To limit the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, control of excess weight may be crucial for individuals with chronic liver disease, especially those with chronic hepatitis C.

AB The contribution of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores to the rise in the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](c)) triggered by Ca2+ influx was investigated in mouse pancreatic beta-cells. Depolarization of beta-cells by 45 mM K+ (in the presence of 15 mM glucose and 0.1 mM diazoxide) evoked two types of [Ca2+](c) responses: a monotonic and sustained elevation; or a sustained elevation superimposed by a transient [Ca2+](c) peak (TCP) (40-120 s after the onset of depolarization). Simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+](c) and voltage-dependent Ca2+ current established that the TCP did not result from a larger Ca2+ current. Abolition of the TCP by thapsigargin and its absence in sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 3 (SERCA3) knockout mice show that it is caused by Ca2+ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum. A TCP could not be evoked by the sole depolarization of beta-cells but required a rise in [Ca2+](c) pointing to a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). This CICR did not involve inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP(3)Rs) because it was resistant to heparin. Nor did it involve ryanodine receptors (RyRs) because it persisted after blockade of RyRs with ryanodine, and was not mimicked by caffeine, a RyR agonist. Moreover, RyR1 and RyR2 mRNA were not found and RyR3 mRNA was only slightly expressed in purified beta-cells. A CICR could also be detected in a limited number of cells in response to glucose. Our data demonstrate, for the first time in living cells, the existence of an atypical CICR that is independent from the IP3R and the RyR. This CICR is prominent in response to a supraphysiological stimulation with high K+, but plays little role in response to glucose in non-obese mouse pancreatic beta-cells.

AB A population-based case-control proband study was undertaken to elucidate familial aggregation, independent environmental factors, and the interaction between them. A total of 7308 metabolic syndrome (MET-S) cases were identified from the Keelung community-based integrated screening programme between 1999 and 2002. The study has a case-control/family sampling design. A total of 1417 case probands were randomly selected from 3225 metabolic syndrome cases and the corresponding 2458 controls selected from 16,519 subjects without metabolic syndrome by matching on sex, age ( 3 years) and place of residence. The generalized estimation equation model was used to estimate odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The risk for having metabolic syndrome among family members for cases versus control probands was 1.56-fold (1.29-1.89) after controlling for significant environmental factors. Higher risk of metabolic syndrome was found in parents than spouse. Low education against high education had 2.06-fold (1.36-3.13) risk for metabolic syndrome. Betel quid chewing was positively associated with the risk of MET-S, with 1.99-fold (1.13-3.53) risk for 1-9 pieces and 1.76-fold (0.96-3.23) risk for > 10 pieces compared with non-chewer. Moderate and high intensity of non-occupational exercise led to 2 1.0% (OR= 0.79 (0.63-0.98)) and 26.0% (OR= 0.74 (0.59-0.94)) reduction in the risk for metabolic syndrome, respectively. The frequent consumption of vegetable reduced 24.0% (OR = 0.76 (0.62-0.92)) risk for MET-S. The frequent consumption of coffee was associated the increased risk for metabolic syndrome (OR = 1.32 (1.07-1.64)). The present study confirmed the risk of metabolic syndrome not only has the tendency towards familial aggregation but is affected by independent effect of environmental or individual correlates.

AB American men have a lifetime risk of about 18% for prostate cancer diagnosis. Large international variations in prostate cancer risks and increased risks among migrants from low- to high-risk countries indicate important roles for environmental factors. Major known risk factors include age, family history, and country/ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes appears to reduce risk, while high birth weight and adult height are linked to increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer. Limited evidence supports an association with a history of sexually transmitted infections. A previous meta-analysis of eight cohort studies indicated no associations with plasma androgen, estrogen, or sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. However, there were dose-response relationships with baseline plasma testosterone levels in two studies that adjusted for other serum hormones and obesity. Finasteride (a drug that blocks testosterone activation) reduced prostate cancer risk by 25%. Low-frequency genes linked to familial prostate cancer only explain a small fraction of all cases. Sporadic cases were linked to relatively common polymorphisms of genes involved in (1) androgen synthesis, activation, inactivation and excretion, (2) hormone and vitamin D receptors, (3) carcinogen metabolism, and (4) DNA repair. Epidemiologic evidence supports protective roles for dietary selenium, vitamin E, pulses, tomatoes/lycopene, and soy foods, and high plasma 1,25-diliydroxyvitamin D levels. There is inadequate evidence that vegetables, fruit, carotenoids, and vitamins A and C reduce risk and that animal fat, alpha-linoleic acid, meat, coffee, and tea increase risk. Two major cohort studies found dose-response relationships with dietary calcium intake. Total dietary energy intake may enhance risk. Limited evidence supports a protective role for physical activity and elevated risk for farmers and other men with occupational pesticide exposure, particularly to organochlorine compounds and phenoxy herbicides. There is inadequate evidence for a relationship with alcohol or smoking. Most known or suspected external risk factors may act through hormonal mechanisms, but our review found little supporting evidence, and substantial further research is needed.

AB Background: The need to promote a healthy diet to curb the current obesity epidemic has today been recognized by most countries. A prerequisite for planning and evaluating interventions on dietary intake is the existence of valid information on long-term average dietary intake in a population. Few large, population-based studies of dietary intake have been carried out in Sweden. The largest to date is the Vasterbotten Intervention Program ( VIP), which was initiated in 1985, with data collection still ongoing. This paper reports on the first comprehensive analyses of the dietary data and presents dietary intake patterns among over 60,000 women and men in northern Sweden during 1992-2005.
   Methods: Between 1992 and 2005, 71,367 inhabitants in Vasterbotten county aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years visited their local health care center as part of the VIP. Participants of VIP filled in an 84- or 64-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and provided sociodemographic information. Complete and realistic information on consumption frequency was provided by 62,531 individuals. Food intake patterns were analyzed using K-means cluster analyses.
   Results: The mean daily energy intake was 6,83 (+/- 1,77) MJ among women and 8,71 (+/- 2,26) MJ among men. More than half of both women and men were classified as Low Energy Reporters ( defined as individuals reporting a food intake level below the lower 95% confidence interval limit of the physical activity level). Larger variation in frequency of daily intake was seen among women than among men for most food groups. Among women, four dietary clusters were identified, labeled "Fruit and vegetables", "High fat", "Coffee and sandwich", and "Tea and ice cream". Among men, three dietary clusters were identified, labeled "Fruit and vegetables", "High fat", and "Tea, soda and cookies".
   Conclusion: More distinct food intake patterns were seen among women than men in this study in northern Sweden. Due to large proportions of Low Energy Reporters, our results on dietary intake may not be suitable for comparisons with recommended intake levels. However, the results on food intake patterns should still be valid and useful as a basis for targeting interventions to groups most in need.

AB Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the acute metabolic effects of a high-energy drink in healthy, physically-active women.
   Methods: Ten women (20.4 +/- 0.70 y; 166.9 +/- 7.2 cm; 67.0 +/- 7.0 kg; 29.6 +/- 6.5% body fat) underwent two testing sessions administered in a randomized and double-blind fashion. Subjects reported to the laboratory in a 3-hr post-absorptive state and were provided either 140 ml of the high-energy drink (SUP; commercially marketed as Meltdown RTD (TM) or placebo (P). Subjects consumed two 70 ml doses of SUP or P, separated by 30 min and rested in a semi-recumbent position for 3 hours. Resting oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR) were determined every 5 min during the first 30 min and every 10 min during the next 150 min. Blood pressure (BP) was determined every 15 min during the first 30 min and every 30 min thereafter. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was computed for VO2, whereas a 3-hour average and hourly averages were calculated for respiratory quotient (RQ), total kcal, HR, BP, and profile of mood states (POMS).
   Results: AUC analysis revealed a 10.8% difference (p = 0.03) in VO2 between SUP and P. No difference in VO2 was seen between the groups in the first hour, but VO2 in SUP was significantly greater than P in the second (13.9%, p = 0.01) and third hours (11.9%, p = 0.03). A difference (p = 0.03) in energy expenditure was seen between SUP (1.09 +/- 0.10 kcal.min(-1)) and P (0.99 +/- 0.09 kcal.min(-1)) for the 3-hour period. Although no difference in energy expenditure was seen in the first hour, significant differences between SUP and P were observed in the second (1.10 +/- 0.11 kcal.min(-1) and 0.99 +/- 0.09 kcal.min(-1), respectively; p = 0.02) and third hour (1.08 +/- 0.11 kcal.min(-1) and 0.99 +/- 0.09 kcal.min(-1), respectively; p = 0.05). Average systolic BP was significantly higher (p = 0.007) for SUP (110.0 +/- 3.9 mmHg) compared to P (107.3 +/- 4.4 mmHg). No differences were seen in HR, diastolic BP, or POMS at any time point.
   Conclusions: Results showed a significant increase in energy expenditure in young, healthy women following an acute ingestion of a high-energy drink.

TI Food consumption patterns in an adult urban population in Beirut,

   dietary pattern; Lebanon
ID NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; CHILDREN
AB Objectives To investigate, measure and assess the food consumption pattern of the adult population living in Beirut, Lebanon, and to identify inadequate or excessive intake of food groups particularly linked to non-communicable diseases.
   Design A cross-sectional food consumption survey was conducted in 2001. Dietary habits were assessed by means of a quantitative food-frequency questionnaire.
   Setting Dietary survey of the urban population (Beirut).
   Subjects Random sample of 444 adult subjects (aged 25-54 years) in Beirut.
   Results The mean consumption of food by the study population was estimated to be 3030 g day(-1), providing an energy intake of 2523.57 kcal day(-1). Fat contributed 38.9% to the average daily energy intake, protein 13.4% and carbohydrates 47.2%. Mean consumption of fruits and vegetables was approximately 367 g day(-1) and 45.3% of subjects consumed less than the recommended 400 g daily. Cereals contributed 324.5 g day(-1), providing 35.0% of daily energy intake, with bread being the most highly consumed (146.2 g day(-1)) in this food group. The mean intake of meat and poultry products was 91.7 g day(-1) and provided 8.8% of daily energy intake, with consumption of butchery products especially beef being the highest (47.6 g day(-1)) followed by poultry (36.1 g day(-1)). A low consumption of fish was noted (19.7 g day(-1)), with 73.6% of subjects consuming less than the recommended 2 servings of fish per week. Dairy products contributed 243.1 g day(-1) or 10.9% of daily energy intake, and milk was the least consumed dairy product (56.8% of consumers). The intake of added fats and oils, excluding those in cooked recipes, was 20.4 g day(-1); olive oil was not used in cooking but was added solely at the table and its mean intake was 5 g day(-1). The consumption of butter was low (0.86 g day(-1)) and vegetable oil was the type of fat mostly used in cooking. The average intake of alcoholic beverages was low (33.6 g day(-1)), accounting for 0.7% of total energy intake. Women had significantly higher intakes of milk, dairy products, vegetables and coffee than men (P < 0.05). The percentage of women who reported the use of low-fat items was significantly higher than that of men. Younger people (25-34 years) ate significantly more meat, sugar, alcoholic beverages and soft drinks, and consumed significantly less cooked vegetables and legumes, than older ones (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions The rather high contribution of fat to daily energy intake, the low intake of fish and the relatively high percentage of people consuming less than the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables observed in this study suggest that the adult Lebanese population is at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, obesity and other non-communicable diseases, which provides the basis for recommending increased intakes of fish, particularly fatty fish, and fruits and vegetables.
